I’ve almost completely lost my appetite, and my sleep has become really irregular. For the past 6 months, I’ve been sleeping 12–13+ hours a day, and sometimes I don’t sleep at all. Just today, I slept for around 17 hours straight.

I also missed my period last month—and now this month too. When I brought it up, my parents said it’s just due to stress and that I don’t need to see a doctor. But these symptoms feel a bit too extreme to just brush off.

Should I be pushing harder to get medical help, or could this really all be stress-related?

1jr7gts,mentalhealth,1743757440.0,"I don’t know how to be alone In the last 8 years I have always been in a relationship, jumping more or less from one person to the next. 

One month ago, my last relationship ended, although in my head it ended 6 months ago. We had a big fight before the winter season, and we hardly talked/saw each other during the last months, I think it was 5 or 6 times between December and March. So yeah, in my head although I wasn’t single I felt single. Now we officially broke up a month ago, and I absolutely hate it. Probably because during this last relationship I also lost most my friends, so I feel extremely lonely. 
I miss having someone special around, although I enjoy being by myself most of the time. It just gets so fucking lonely and depressing after a while. I don’t think I would be able to jump into a relationship now, I need my space, but I miss having someone. 

I found myself drunk-texting an ex, meeting up with them, and realizing how much I miss them. We broke up 10 years ago and haven’t really seen each other except on very few occasions. They made me laugh so much, it felt so natural and easy to talk! 

I met with another ex (yeah, I know, great choices) yesterday and again, it felt good to chat, we had some beers and the conversation took a turn I already regret. I don’t even know what I want, I live in a small town where I know most people and keep running into the same people even if I don’t want to.

1jr75v7,mentalhealth,1743756075.0,"I have accepted a new job and I can't get out of bed So I'm a 40yo male with lifelong addiction and depression problems related to a truckload of trauma from a broken single parent drug-fueled childhood.

I've been working remotely for about 2 years now from a vacation town where I own a (mortgaged) house. I take care of my disabled and mildly demented mother. I have fine compensation and great benefits and have a ""comfortable"" life while avoiding as much life as possible. I barely leave my house to go to my gfs in the weekends (who is oblivious to most of my mental issues even though she tries to empathize) and I spend the rest of my days working high from home.

Recently I got a job offer from a startup for an extra 30% compensation and since I need to send my mother to a hospice sooner than later (she's gotten worse in the last months ) I jumped into the opportunity and accepted the job without thinking twice. 
However the job is mostly in person and would require giving up a hardcore stable job that allows me working from my vacation town, and no longer having my mother under control.
I also accepted since I thought this would also align with the plan of moving with my gf soon (in a couple of months).

But since I handed my resignation I'm unable to move from bed. I'm paralyzed by fear, and I feel like I fucked up big time. I am angry at my girlfriend for no reason and I avoid her and even though I tried talking to therapists, I have no real quality feedback and my friends think that I'm either awesome for getting that job or dumb for giving up working barely a couple of hours a day from home (I really had everything under control in my current job)

The worst of all is that I don't even know what is really going on with me but Ive been losing control of myself lately (before the job offer) and this is somehow making it worse and I feel like going into a public setting in my current mental state will led to a blow up..

I wanted to ask you for ideas, insight or a different perspective because I'm really downhill and I'm afraid I might be making things worse.

Thank you

I am deeply confused because I have recently been experiencing an emotional state that can only be described as purely negative or emotional suffering- it feels alien to normal feelings of sadness/hopelessness/resentment and is different than the nothingness of depression or overwhelming-ness of strong anxiety. I can only describe it as just the feeling of agony- and while there are certainly negative thoughts that accompany it, its more like thoughts of hating the world for allowing me (or anyone else, for that matter) to experience it than any more traditional mental health thought pattern. It feels like it's a circle enclosing the middle part of my head, like its emotional pain is originating near/below the temples and it physically hurts too. It is causing me immense distress and has recently induced in me a sort of insomnia.

2: I feel like I have ""too much empathy"" for one certain person. (That being my mom) Whatever I try to do I always think about ""would my mom like this? Probably, so I have to like it too."" Or ""hm, I don't think my mom would like it, so I don't either"" for example one day I was having a conversation with a friend and they started being sarcastic with me, but that empathy hit me and I thought to myself ""I know my mom doesn't like when I speak sarcastic to her, so I don't think she would want me to be in this conversation."" 

3: I have really bad anger issues, but in a way where I don't express it, it's just there. I get super mad at small things and keep it to myself, usually I'll just stop talking or go in a separate room and cry in anger if I can.

1jr3p4d,mentalhealth,1743741818.0,"How to deal with depressed mother 
Six years ago, we had a family member of our stay with us. She seemed great at first, but she faked having cancer and took extreme emotional advantage of my mother who struggled with depression, but at the time had a full-time job and was thriving.

We found out that this sociopathic family member was lying about everything and my mom absolutely went off the rails. 

Since that day, she’s been in the mental hospital three times  in two years, and has not been there in four years. I had to drive her there when she was severely mentally ill multiple times.

She’s on five different medication’s, was an alcoholic, and a weed addict at different points, and she has stopped all of that currently. I became a weed addict for a while, constantly hitting her weed pen whenever she wasn’t around. This lasted for about four years. The last two months I’ve been mostly sober, I do drink beer every night (1-2 cans of German lager). 


I’m so sick of sitting in this pile of shit house. I used to be more full of passion but being in this house is destroying me in ways I can’t describe. I had trouble communicating with women. I get the same feeling with other women that I do when I see my mom. Nothing. I don’t know what to say or to do. 

My dad travels for a living and has gone very frequently for one to two weeks at a time. Since the incident about four years ago, my brother got married and moved out. Both of our dogs and died, just leaving me and her alone at the house. She has “learned helplessness” and constantly ask me to do menial things that she can do herself. She is bipolar and depressed, and we’ve had huge fights in the past but lately things have been more tame.

After five years of exposure than this, I’ve become extraordinarily emotionally numb to her. When I look at my grandma, my dad, my brother and friends, I feel loved, and I can reciprocate the emotions they give me. When I look at my mom, I feel absolutely nothing. Most of the time she is horrifically depressed, and is trying to fish compliment out of me. Constantly trying to get me to show her any type of affection. All of this has made me emotionally numb as a defense mechanism. She can be manic, or extremely depressed. I feel nothing with her regardless of how she is doing. Most of the time she is extremely depressed, and when I come home from school or work and do the bare minimum amount of talking to get pastor and upstairs where I hang out in my admittedly, pretty cool room. 

I’ve developed anger issues towards her. We cannot connect in any other way, except anger. She’s constantly asking me to do menial things, and always tries to offload responsibilities to anyone else but herself. When she watches my brothers kids, she’s always asking me to do things to help her. Put the kids to bed for naps, fill up her water cup, do the dishes (she never does them) clean up the kitchen after her, and much more. 

It’s gotten to a point where everyone in my family expects me to try and take care of her, but I want absolutely no part in this. 

She complains how I never “kiss her good night anymore”. I’m 26. I don’t need to do that. It’s disgusting.

I’m getting unbelievably sick of constantly dealing with this. My brother and his wife moved in and they have had a baby. They’ve been here for the last eight months, but they are planning on moving out soon so we’re gonna be going back to Dog shit again soon

Any advice in what to do?

1jr36n0,mentalhealth,1743740028.0,"How do I deal with a new realization and potentially talk to my parents about that? So, I've recently come to realize quite a few things about myself and my past. As pretext: I don't remember much from my past, almost nothing, to be honest, even from my teen years (I'm currently 20). I'm pretty sure I've successfully repressed a number of inaccessible memories. 

To come to the point of my mentioned realization: I've had an objectively *good* childhood, but not particularly a *happy* one. Which was pretty clear in my teen years (I pretty much only remember being highly depressed), but now I'm also sure it has always extended further back, into early childhood. And honestly, I really don’t know how to handle that. I'm so lost on how to feel or process this, even with the help of my therapist. It has left me with... permanent repercussions, so to speak. 

Additionally, I know my family did their best, and there were a lot of factors that weren't easy to control or controllable at all, and they did all they could for me. I'm endlessly grateful. However, I don't know how to explain my new perspective to them, especially my mother, who's both quite emotional when it comes to her children's problems, as well as unable to really understand situations she herself has never lived through (which is the case with this one). 

I've talked to my therapist already and we've been working on possible scenarios should it ever come to a difficult conversation with my mother, but I'd still appreciate any other insights and maybe some other experiences of people who've dealt with similar situations before and had to go through this kind of paradigm shift and how they dealt with that.

1jr1le1,mentalhealth,1743734825.0,"I Need a Break My birthday is in a week and have no desire to celebrate my life.

I do not know how much more bad sh!t I can take. How do people pick up the pieces and keep going?!

I was laid off from my dream job on 11/1 in Chicago after being unemployed for over a year. I was unemployed for so long that I used up all my unemployment benefits and I had to move in with my angry boyfriend with no self-esteem & his 2 lazy boys (11 & 17). I am reminded daily that he pays the rent and utilities while I pay for the food, internet & phones. His boys do not help around the house, leaves messes that I end up cleaning up, if I mention it to my boyfriend, he gets upset & starts beating himself up that he’s a “bad father”.

With the mess in the US, jobs will be less available and more competition for that 1 job. I have a part-time job that doesn’t pay well where I stuff envelopes, answer the phone & wait on people at the window who need to pay their water bill or police ticket. It’s boring to the nth degree. I am a creative, been in the graphic design/food packaging/printing industry for ages and it’s killing me. I have barely any creative outlet.

On top of my struggle with an angry, hopeless, negative, non-empathic, no-self-esteem boyfriend who talks about taking himself out daily and looking every day for a job, I am now dealing with a medical crisis that leaves me with chronic pain in my chest (extreme heartburn). It got so bad I ended up in the ER last week and I have no desire to eat since eating (and breathing) causes me so much pain. In the ER, I found out about the extreme heartburn, found out about a hernia, and found that I have gallstones. The pain & discomfort are unbearable at times that I cry. My boyfriend gets mad and starts yelling because he doesn’t know what to do, screams at me to tell him what I need, and he’s very negative while I am doubled over in pain. All I want, and I’ve told him, is to be comforted, no words needed. I will be getting an endoscopy (tube camera put down the throat) sometime soon to see how bad the damage is to my esophagus. All I know is that the lower part of my esophagus has thickened due to the abundance of stomach acid. The ER doc told me this week that there is a possibility of cancer. Found out today that I was rejected for another role (a game changer) just like my dream job.

My life has not been easy from the start and I daydream about the day when I am not struggling financially, mentally, & physically, a day where I am wanted & needed, a day where I have someone who actually loves & cares for me as I do so for so many. My birthday is in a week and have no desire to celebrate my life.

Yes, I have a therapist and so does my boyfriend. I do not take medication (yet) to help with my mental distress. Thank gwad I have weed to help talk me off the ledge.

Sorry if theres any grammatical errors or anything like that. Also, feel free to invalidate how I feel thats kinda what Im looking for lol

        I dont really know what to think anymore. I feel like a completely different person from week to week, day to day and sometimes hour to hour. Theres times where I am suicidal and existential, depressed, disconnected, hopeless and isolated. I get angry at the mere thought of interaction, although I continue to feel these things for weeks on end, I do nothing; Its almost as if I want to feel this way, perhaps because its who I truely am. I something barely feel human. I hate people and interacting with them so much most of the time its so abnormal to me. Alternatively, theres times i feel super excited and jittery about nothing, I cant sit still nor control myself and I connect and interact with people with ease and even joy at times; I completely forget about any of my struggles and hardships and become a completely different person it seems. If I was independent and had nobody to keep me in check, Im worried of what I would do. My ideals and what I believe in commonly changes through these phases, I have violent and anarchic thoughts often and severely struggle with living. I do not know why I dont act on my violent thoughts other than to keep my family happy. How is a thought supposed to just be a thought? I dont even know. On the contrary, when Im 'good' I love socializing, the idea of participating in my community and family, and optimistic for the future of myself and of the world. I cannot and it makes it really hard to maintain relationships with people because one moment I love talking with people and then despise them the next. People are people, why do I have to connect and put myself out there when I dont want to. I dont want to so bad; why? Moreover, along with the shift in emotions and ideals, my hygiene, cleanliness, art style, handwriting, and behaviors change as well. Isolation, uncleanness and less consistent art and sleep is common when Im depressed and disconnected. I miss out on showers, brushing my teeth or hair or just changing clothes. On the other hand, the next week I can become obsessed with my art and its appearance; same goes for my room and clothes. I start buying clothes I probably dont need, my desire to improve myself is too much to ignore at times; I cant tell if thats a good thing or not. Again, these changes severely effect my ability to consistently be social and active in my family and school because how am I supposed to act when I barely know who I am? I dont know. Furthermore, theres times Im all of this at the same time which makes the shifts even more confusing.  I feel like theres something inherently wrong about me. But again, I really, really do not know.

1jr0jwk,mentalhealth,1743731601.0,"34. Live at home with a my mom and disabled brother. I live at home with my mother and my disabled older brother. I'm 34, my mom is 72 and my brother is 46. My brother has has schizophrenia since the age of 24. He was in medical school before he developed acute psychosis and then came home to live with my older sister and I. I had a difficult life growing up for a middle-class suburban kid. My parents divorced when I was 7. My mom worked as a waitress to keep us afloat before becoming a nurse. I developed an eating disorder in 7th grade around the same time my brother developed schizophrenia and came to live with us. It was a difficult home to live in with him around. Dealing with his psychosis has been like living life on repeat every day. Every day he has fixations, every day there are delusions, weird body language, strange content of conversations, sexual obsessions, etc. He also lacks awareness of his own condition it seems as well. As he grew older with the disease, he eventually developed full blown OCD. Repetitive tics, entering a door and going back through it 20 times in a row, opening and shutting microwave doors the same way, repetitive hand washing, etc.  I was exposed to a lot of disturbed thinking during this time until I left home for college. 

I was doing well academically at school but not well socially. I experienced consistent exclusion from social groups and mild bullying at times throughout my years as a school kid. I developed an irrational fear of women and I had severe social anxiety. By around 10th grade, I developed an addictive habit of gaming and porn use. This has persisted to this day. I never got over my fear of women. I did well academically in high school and okay in college. I could have gone to medical school with my GPA if I applied myself to studying for the MCAT but by the end of college, I was suicidal and depressed and developed a drinking problem. I ended up becoming a nurse (not an insult to nurses, I love my coworkers). Nursing school forced me to open up a lot. I had a great 2 years of life during this time actually. The constant exposure to women who I had to see every day (since most of my classmates were women) forced me to evolve and I actually became more social and less anxious by the end of this time.

I ended up taking up my first job as a nurse in a night shift position. After doing night shift for 5 years, I fell back into isolating habits and also regularly drank again. I tried so many times to quit porn but still use it today. It just feels like a high i can't left go of. It numbs me to the world and gives me something to look forward to every day. Im also 34 and never have had a girlfriend. I had a fling at age 29 with the only girl I'd ever done anything with up to that point in time but since then, I've been alone again.

1jr02b8,mentalhealth,1743730110.0,"Im unsure am I even depressed anymore. This is going to be quite a short post as I don't really want to do long posts yet\~

Ive been going through university lately and Im not going to deny I'm suffering from stress. But as of late I've been realising something, Ive kind of been depressed for most my life and maybe even constantly over the last decade or less. I am still diagnosed with depression as I present most if not all mental symptoms and lately have started to present light physical symptoms.

It feels like my default mood is just sadness most of the time but now that I'm meeting more people when they are depressed they seem to be more impacted by it than me. For example they barely go outside to do anything, cry for hours and the classical symptoms but it looks so heavy for them and affects them to even the next day. Dont get me wrong I experience all of these but at considerably lower severity but more often. For example I do cry yes, multiple times in a row sometimes too for an hour or two but they never really leave an emotion mark, I still go outside just to eat warm food and interact with people as although it sucks and makes me sad I get at least a positive benefit and as of late I've had loss of appetite compelty for a week but I still make an effort to try to eat *even though I don't and it leaves so much trash and rotten food.*

It makes me think maybe I don't have depression anymore? I mean I feel it everyday and wish I had no symptoms inflicted on me but lately It just doesn't affect me as much anymore.

This is more about the science of life and wellbeing, no matter what state you are in, I want you to know it is okay. There is no such thing as perfect.

I have been crying at every few hour intervals for the past few days, bawling and completely surrendering and feeling so alone and empty. It is genuinely hell. I have dealt with feelings of isolation and depression most my life, but I would trade it in a heartbeat for this feeling, it would feel like mercy comparatively.

 It all stemmed from the idea of fatalism and that essentially, everything that has ever happened or will ever happen is out of our control.

The universe starting set off a chain reaction which led to me and the rest of my life is like a robot. It's terrifying because every emotion I feel is real I think but this makes it seem like my life is pointless and everyone I love and care about is fake. I question my consciousness. And the worst part about it is that fatalism is fundamentally a true concept. But how do I feel then? 

I am so scared and feel so alone. This unironically feels like some sort of eldritch knowledge I wasn't supposed to figure out.

Ever since my 2nd to last semester in college in 2022, I've been on a downward spiral.  My family sucks and don't get along, I can't get a job in software development  no matter how much I practice, and I lost a childhood friend who I haven't seen in 6 years.

In terms of my friend it is really fucked up.  I think of suicide nearly everyday. Last year was brutal as  I lost my doberman to heart disease and career issues.  I was 27 at the time so fuck it might as well join the 27 club.  I dabbled in partial hanging and slowly was  figuring out.  He last messaged me in late February, but my dog passed on Feb 2nd so I've never seen it.  Around early June I messaged back (we talked through xbox mainly) and brought up the idea of hanging out again.  No response.  I did it again, on Jul 1st.  Keep in mind my bday was july 11th. No response. Fast forward  sometime in August,  for shits and giggles I googled him and found his obituary page.  Turns out he passed away in a car accident May 18th, so I've been talking to a ghost.  In my mind it is so fucked up that I didn't kill myself because I wanted to see him, but he was gone by the time I messaged him, so I was holding out for nothing.

Once I found out I was crashing out, with some self harm (not going into detail)

I hate myself so much for not making time for him as he is the only childhood friend I had that I still talked to.  I was in college and had car trouble, and also was job hunting which is also pointless as i cant land anything.

1jqxl0h,mentalhealth,1743722844.0,"Abandonment and Rejection Issue How do I fight the overwhelming sadness and feelings of abandonment that I get?

I get these feelings now over the smallest things, and it sometimes takes days to get over. I know what causes it, I have been let down, abandoned, or left by so many people throughout my life (sometimes to no fault of their own) that now even just a canceled date sends me into a dark place for a day or two.

This week has been some of the worst feelings I’ve had of this. 

On Monday I was supposed to go out on a date, drove halfway there (he lives an hour away), and he texted me to see if we could reschedule to Wednesday because he was sick. In his defense, he had snapped me earlier in the day to say he wasn’t feeling the greatest.

Tuesday I was supposed to go see a good friend of mine I haven’t been able to hang out with in a few months, but as I got home Monday (from the canceled date) he also called to cancel for Tuesday because of work. 

So Tuesday I was pretty down but at least I had the rescheduled date for Wednesday to look forward to right? Wrong… Wednesday comes and he was going to text me when he got off of work so we could meet. I hear nothing from him, by 7 I gave up hope for that night and just lost it. I didn’t eat, I just went to bed and cried. All I want to do is sleep because I’m sick of crying. I had to pull myself together today and put on a happy face for work. As soon as I got to my car in the parking garage after work I felt an immense numb feeling and sadness. I sat there for almost an hour because I physically couldn’t put my hands on the steering wheel.

As I type this out, I’m laying in bed, wanting to just sleep, but wanting to write this out to try and get it out of my head in a way. How can I make this stop? As much as I am willing to right now, I can’t go to therapy. I make too much to get it for free/reduced cost and I make too little to be able to afford it. I can’t go for a walk or go outside, it’s fucking cold and I am honestly afraid of seeing people having fun together, it’ll only make me angry/lonely.

I have been feeling like utter trash because of how on and off I am on and off I am on my schoolwork. All it does is eat at my mind and no matter what I do, I always feel like I’m going to fail. It’s gotten so bad to the point I’m just think gonna wait it out and get my GED, I really just don’t wanna think about it man it just hurts so bad and I just feel so useless about it. It’s like ever since I homeschooled nothing has gotten better, it has only gotten worse and it likely will just get worse over time. I’ve done some work but after I do it, I kind of just hate touching it because it stresses me out severely, and it makes me feel like I may be neurodivergent since it feels like the only way this is happening because this should’ve gotten better, not terribly worse over time. I do also have anxiety and depression and likely other things that just make my education worse. And I can’t just “push through it” because I just can’t do things I hate and despise, it will just cause me to have a breakdown or a panic attack later. I feel I need to apologize to all the people who were involved with my education and just punish myself. I just feel like a really big failure and is just the stupidest and biggest crybaby, since I am crying/breaking down about this whole mess I made. I have struggled with things before and I eventually gotten through them, even when they sucked and took a really big tole on me. But this is something I’m gonna have to live with, because now my education is practically fucked and it will likely hold me back forever. I can just imagine my future now and it just looks so dull and terrible, and I’m just like really scared about it. What if I just tell my “hey this child that you love and thought was going to have an education is actually really dumb and can’t do shit”? What will happen when I have to admit this stuff? Will I be judged for it, will they understand me, will just hate me, will they feel the same, like what will they do? I’m scared.

1jqw3co,mentalhealth,1743718896.0,"Is this life? Hello fellow redditors,

I think I’m having a bit of an “early life crisis” right now (or something like that). Since the beginning of 2024, I’m in a state of permanent stress – whether it’s private or business. I often work longer than I’m supposed to. I often dream of work and have a hard time falling asleep thinking about all the things I’m supposed to get done the next day/week/month... A few days ago, I was at the dermatologist because my hair started thinning and falling out in bursts around a year ago - those bursts of extreme hair loss seem to be stress induced. Outside of work, things aren’t better. I’m a member of three wind orchestras, one of which I conduct and another of which I am assistant conductor. I also like (well, at least I enjoyed it before it became my very unprofitable part-time profession) composing and arranging music, especially for wind orchestras. I play a few different instruments and I’ve just picked up the oboe in an attempt to find something that brings me joy again. What once seemed like the last escape from reality does not even excite me anymore. I’m no longer excited for the weekly rehearsals. I no longer enjoy starting up my computer to create music. I do it because I must, I do it because so many people expect me to perform. There is so much pressure on my shoulders that I can hardly bear it anymore. 4 years ago, I quit school to start an apprenticeship, which I will complete in the following months. I’m now catching up on my matura (general qualification for university entrance) in an attempt to make up for this mistake. I try my best to live healthily, hitting the gym 3 times a week, going cycling and eating healthy… which I can only do, when all other tasks for the day are done, which inevitably leads me to staying awake until around 2am every day. In the past few months, I think I’ve started beginning to notice the effects of this lifestyle. I’m basically tired all the time. I’ve lost my creditability because I’m never on time due to having working late or having too many different appointments. My communication skills seem to have worsened over the past year as well. I can hardly make time for my friends and relationships. I no longer find it easy to say “I’m fine” when some of my closest friends ask me how I’m doing. I don’t have anyone to talk about what’s going on, because I don’t want to bother anyone with my problems. I’m sleep deprived and I’m finding it harder to socialize, way harder than it’s ever been for me. I can not stop thinking about all the things I have to get done in such incredibly short periods of time. I’m never satisfied with my output. I’m never the best at what I do, there’s always someone that’s still doing better than me, which leads me to doing even more things and sleeping even less… I honestly just can’t anymore. A month ago I had my first ever panic attack which I hope will never happen again. I’m 19 and all those things are completely eating me up. In a few months, I will be enlisting in the military and after that, I’m supposed to move out and live my life like every other person. How are you supposed to fit all this together?

1jqvv3z,mentalhealth,1743718299.0,"Is it possible for a person to go through CSA and not suffer from serious long term trauma I have no idea what triggered this or why it specifically had to happen around this time, but recently, I've come to terms with the fact that I was SA'd at a young age. I know this, and have had a clear memory of the events since the point that they took place, but it just took me about 7 or 8 years to understand that what'd happened to me qualified as sexual assault. It is something that, whenever the topic was brought up, my immediate thought process was one of ""yeah, not something I have ever been through, but...well, there was that one time. i probably shouldnt talk about it cause it sounds really bad, but its not like that"". And while now i can least admit that yes, it was like that, what exactly this entails for me or my mental health has been extremely, extremely difficult to understand.

So, I should tell you I have had my share of problems in the past. I'm diagnosed with autism, depression and anxiety, although at times I don't really agree with that last one. Saying that isn't really much though. Being more specific while staying general, I am someone who for a long time has struggled with low or abysmal self worth, suicidal ideation/attempting, near constant dissociation and detatchment from my sense of self, strong social anxiety (moreso when i was younger) and also paranoia. Ordinary stuff all things considered. The thing is, I have always ascribed these behaviors and symptons of mine to a variety of other origins. Or at least that is what I do when I'm in the capable state of mind to process things. But they made sense to me. Right now they still do, but its just. I dont know. like. What if? i am Almost sure that i dont have ptsd or anything, like really i dont think i do, but it just scares me. the thought of having gone through so much and even any part of that at all being caused by that type of. damage, for lack of a better word, is really scary.  For a bit i rationalized that in actuality i had not even been traumatized at all, but then i mentioned it for the first time to a close friend and i kind of broke down crying. which isnt very normal. 

The part i dont get the least is a feeling of. Not making sense of how i should feel. or how i should have felt throughout all these years. The thing is, the person that did this, i know them. Personally, to this day. Me and my immediate family meet with them once or twice a year. We go to their house, we eat together. And this whole time i think ive just been. Fine with it. And it is not as if what happened to me was something i ever enjoyed at any moment. I know what happened, i know it made me feel vulnerable and unsafe and strange when it did, but i guess beyond that i could never recognize it impacting me in any other way. really as a kid i thought it was just supposed to happen. i could never see that this person did something i didnt want because they desired it, because they got something out of it, it just made sense because they were an adult and therefore knew better than me. So no, never in mind could i register them as a fucked up monster or an abuser, especially as a family member. But then that leaves me at my present day position, where i at the same time know two things, one that they assaulted me, and two that sexual assault is evil, and yet i can still not see them as evil.

1jqvucf,mentalhealth,1743718245.0,"Meds that are supposed to help my mental health aren’t working. TW: Medical, Anxiety/Depression

I started getting help for my mental health around January of this year. After struggling with debilitating depression and anxiety for 6 years now and having no support in college, I made an appointment with my PCP got prescribed Lexapro.
I took 5 mg for the first few days, and it just felt off, but as soon as I started taking10 mg, everything got so much worse. I was skipping lectures, sleeping for most of the day and all night, not eating, and, worse of all, my suicidal thoughts got worse. I thought this was normal, until it got so bad that I was crying myself to sleep and failing all my classes. I called my PCP and was told to immediately stop the medication and take a leave of absence from school.

I then enrolled in a partial hospitalization program to get CBT and have a medical team that can prescribe me the right meds. As soon as I got there, the psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was on it for two weeks, and it felt like it gave me too much energy. I knew it would mellow out, but last week, I started getting motor and vocal tics. After an hour, it started getting worse and at that point, I drove myself to the ED (can’t afford an ambulance) and was immediately admitted. After I got a shot to stop the tics, I was told to immediately stop taking the Wellbutrin and to go home a rest. The next day, I thought everything would be fine, until I started getting the tics again, so I went to the ED again, this time with my parents. I was told that the Wellbutrin was still in my system and it’ll take some time to get it all out. (This was perfect just before my 19th birthday…) It’s been a week now, and I’m still getting tics, though it’s less intense (I’m taking the oral version of the antidote to take care of it now). But now, Wellbutrin is listed on my medical chart as an allergy.

Now, after all this happened, the nurse practitioner thought that the tics could have been caused by anxiety, so she prescribed me Gabapentin yesterday. I took it last night and then started feeling a bit itchy, but I just chalked that up to be dry skin. Around 11 PM last night, my skin started to get itchier and itchier and, you guessed it, I got tics again. I took the medication that the ED doctor prescribed me and tried to sleep off the itchiness, but I just couldn’t. Everything was SOOOO itchy. At this point, I just wanted to peel my skin off, but I obviously can’t do that, so what do I do? I take a shower in the middle of the night…
Even after I take the shower, I’m still itchy and at this point, am bawling my eyes out because 1. I’m so so tired from taking both the Gabapentin AND the medication for my tics and, 2. I was feeling super hopeless that there was a way for me to be medicated without going to the ED or making my mental health worse. 

So, Gabapentin is now listed as another one of my allergies. Today, I’m spending time at home, still itchy, just trying to figure out why all of this is happening to me and if it’s actually worth all the trouble to fix my mental health problems.

 I hate myself, and I feel useless, like no matter what I do, it won’t make a difference.

My biggest problem is that I have no ambition. I'm incredibly lazy, my health is bad, I have no confidence, and I feel awful about my body. I want to be more energetic and active, but for me, that feels almost impossible.

I used to get really good grades in school, but now I feel stupid. 
Looking back, I realize I didn’t actually learn anything—I just memorized things for a short time, got good marks, and then forgot everything. I feel like I wasted a huge opportunity.

Now I’m 21, getting older every day. I’m in college and will graduate in two years, but I feel like nothing is changing. Every time I try to improve, I just end up back where I started.

I've tried everything—watching motivational videos, reading books, following advice from others—but I always forget and fall back into my old habits. Most of my time is wasted watching p***, dramas, movies, sleeping, eating, or occasionally hanging out. I've never had a disciplined routine for studying or developing skills.

The thing is, I want to learn something. I love the feeling of being good at something—it makes me feel proud and strong—but I can’t even remember the last time I felt that way. The only feeling I know now is shame.

What really gets to me is seeing my peers working hard and moving forward while I’m stuck in the same place I was at 18. It makes me feel depressed, like I’m just wasting my life.

If anyone has been through something similar and found a way out, I would really appreciate your advice. And if you just want to talk, feel free to reach out.

1jqujj5,mentalhealth,1743715045.0,"What am I doing wrong? Am I really the problem? I was kicked out of a discord recently for multiple things. I was in this channel for 8 months no issues before, only started having issues the last 2 weeks.

Summary: (all these I was NEVER warned about before I was removed, except for #2)

1.) venting too much in vent tab about commission work stress for 2 weeks
2.) venting outside of tab multiple times by accident (others have done this multiple times and was warned too)
3.) accidentally misgendered multiple people multiple times
4.) left someone’s username in the picture of the commission, which I didn’t know could lead to doxxing since people outside the discord were upset with the colors

According to the mods, I had multiple complaints about me for these things, and they never once told me these things, or tried to get me to change my behavior, they instead removed me and decided to tell me afterwards. I didn’t use the venting channel 24/7, it was only more recently due to fursuit commission work drama stress. 

Apparently, I made people feel like they couldn’t use the vent channel anymore because I kept talking about stress involving my fursuit commission work for only a couple weeks, that I was needing to finish since I’m a new fursuit maker and have been working on stuff for months, and I didn’t want that all to go to waste if the person themselves isn’t problematic, and I was getting close to finishing the suit that would later cause me drama on TikTok. They looked too similar to a zoo’s character due to the colors, which both the commissioner and I didn’t know until it was pointed out. 

I had to redo parts of the suit itself, so of course I was upset for having to work extra hours to redo stuff when I was already not getting paid for anything other than cost of materials. People told me I should just cancel the commission or only worry about myself, but I told them no because I run the risk of making something for someone bad in the community and not know it until it was too late anyway, and said some people will not like me either direction I go, or no matter what I do online, everyone gets haters at some point. Maybe that’s what made people not like me?

Am I in the wrong here, or was I discriminated against because they just didn’t like I was finishing that commission and had a “love me, hate me” attitude about it? Maybe they thought I was arguing when I wasn’t, which is why I said I wasn’t arguing, but apparently the way I text makes it seem I am?? This whole situation has just traumatized me, and I don’t think I want to talk to furries or people anymore due to the suit drama other than in a professional way, cause if this is how I’ll be treated for a design, which isn’t even from a bad person, I don’t want to be apart of it anymore. Of course I had many tell me the colors of the suit weren’t even a problem, but I deleted all my post talking about it since it had the person’s username in it, and the problem was fixed and people were happy afterwards.

1jqr9kp,mentalhealth,1743707457.0,"NYer looking for psychiatrist Hey, thanks to anyone who reads and can offer any advice to me about this.  So, I most recently have been receiving care from Housing Works (I have Medicaid and Medicare) because I was a heroin addict and they offered addiction services.  The whole time I was using, even once it turned into a fent addiction, my doctor was treating me fairly and prescribing my medications.  Then I decided it was time for me to quit using drugs and I did a not so great crosstaper w suboxone, I really was against the idea of getting and staying on maintenance drugs such as methadone and suboxone because I've always relapsed when using them and tbh I know so many ppl who are now addicted to suboxone who weren't even addicts to begin with that I just didn't want to be dependent on anything at all that had to do with opiates and I thought that would be a good thing.  

Problem is, it's becoming blatantly clear that my doctor is not only disappointed in the fact that I'm not currently using any of those drugs and repeatedly has made it clear that unless I agree to being on a maintenance drug she will not prescribe me anything I need for mental health.  I'm about 70 days clean and have been taken off all meds but one and I'm pretty sure the only reason that wasn't cut was because I can't just be taken off, you need to taper, which I'm now in fear is her next step, she's angry that I refuse to be addicted to a replacement. I'll then be on zero medication, and I very clearly need treatment and have various diagnoses that require medication.  I'm in need of a psychiatrist who is willing to work with someone who is past an addiction and not interested in maintenance drugs.  It's been really scary how I've been treated recently, and I feel like there is an alterior motive they have that I'm unaware of.  I've never seen doctors try so hard to put a clean addict on drugs and literally start stopping all my medication because I refuse to be addicted to suboxone.  I've even been forced to take them while on video.  I need actual mental health care, and my biggest problem right now is w anxiety because she prescribed me Diazepam for the end of my withdrawals, and I actually responded great to it.  It didn't knock me out like xanex does and I was being super active and I was comfortable with my dose and happy overall but the second I jumped off suboxone she said she could no longer prescribe me it because it wasn't ""safe"".  After doing some research it seems that ppl in nyc who have anxiety are having trouble being treated, as many doctors have become very anti-benzo which I can understand but I don't want a doctor who is just outright against any treatment option.  I feel like every patient and case is different and should benefit from whatever has shown benefit.  That then led to many ppl moving from benzos to ketamine for anxiety/ptsd.  (I will continue in a reply because of too many words)

1jqqo9i,mentalhealth,1743706118.0,"A Girl I wanted to ask out committed suicide and I can't stop feeling guilty. I'm posting this on a few subreddits cause I don't know which one fits.

So a year ago I went a wedding. At the event, I saw a really beautiful girl. She was exactly my type. She was from the groom's side and I was from the bride's side. I really wanted to talk to her but I figured that it would come off as kinda creepy. Plus, I noticed that she wasn't smiling that much so she was either tired or not liking the event too much. When we were all dancing, I noticed that she was just standing in the corner alone. I thought about approaching her and starting a conversation and maybe try to convince her to join us. But I figured she wouldn't like some random guy approaching her. The next day my sister and I were talking and I accidentally let it slip that I thought a girl was cute. She asked about her cause her best friend was the bride so she could set me up. I declined again. I never forgot about her though. 

Fast forward to today and this topic is brought up again. My sister asked for her picture again. I was kinda going through it so I went through the wedding photos and found her. She looked at it for a second and told me ""I know her. She is X's sister. She committed suicide recently. She tried a few times before but they couldn't save her this time."" Apparently, she was depressed and had trouble socializing. Remember when I said her expression was familiar. It's cause I had that same expression when I was younger. I desperately hoped for anyone to reach out while standing alone in a corner. I feel like I saw my younger self and ignored him. It felt like a younger me committed suicide. On one hand, I'm kinda glad that I didn't ask her out. What she needed was professional help and not a relationship. I'm pretty sure I couldn't give her the help she needed and I would've suffered due to my own failings. But on the other hand I feel so guilty. What if things were different?

Graduated recently, and now I just feel like I’m floating. Nothing to do. My only real friends found jobs and are working full-time, so they barely have time to hang out. During college, I ended up in the wrong friend groups — the kind who only thought getting high or drunk was “fun.” I had to cut them off for my own sanity, but by the time I realized it, it was too late to make meaningful connections. Engineering majors barely have time for anything outside of surviving.

Now I’m just at home, unemployed since graduation, bored out of my mind, lonely as hell. I go to the gym — honestly the only thing keeping me somewhat grounded. Otherwise, I don’t know where I’d be mentally. I’ve fallen back into my porn addiction and I can feel it messing with my brain again.

I’m trying to quit, slowly. But it’s so hard when there’s nothing else going on in life. No joy, no excitement, no people to share anything with.

I was thinking today, how were these days like year ago in the summer where my mental health was really bad, I felt like I was being watched, judged and pointed as a monster because of my condition named Pectus Excavatum

In the summer like I said, I hated being without t-shirt like EVEN in front of the house, I started to think about to even going to the public pool when I was there with my family, I did not wanted to go to the pool, as soon as I went there the feeling of hundreds and hundreds of judgements were going through my mind like what was that man over there thinking about me, also I cut myself those days and I felt like my mind is burning.

So today I was thinking about how my mental health was better than year ago and felt like I wanted to go back, wanted the feeling of judgement back, maybe it will be the same this summer as it was before i don't know but felt better in winter times. I sometimes think about ending it even these days, geting hit by bus. i was once looking over bridge and imagined myself hanging over highway. This thoughts did not left me like I am still the weak boy.

Does anyone have the feeling to go back and be the same person that strugles and be the person that hated yourself.

1jqlueh,mentalhealth,1743695068.0,"Why Are Psychiatrists So Mean? (Rant) In my 10+ years of being treated in the mental health system, I've experienced and realized only a handful of professionals are empathetic, sympathetic, and kind.

It's been extremely unfortunate that I've found the majority of mental health psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, etc. think that they know the patients better than the patients know themselves. 

Psychiatrists specifically, often diagnose and prescribe medications without educating patients of possible symptoms and side effects. 

A lot of times a patient's treatment is about what the psychiatrist thinks they know as opposed to how a patient feels and what they experience.

I'm not completely certain where the cold and condescending approach comes from but, I will say. Again, there are a handful of wonderful people in the mental health field including psychiatrists who do care.

I once had a psychiatrist prescribed me medication that featured major news networks as causing impulsivity such as gambling and shopping addictions. I also had lawyers hounding me to take on my case to sue the manufacturers. That same psychiatrist insisted that this medication had NO side effects whatsoever. I don't think there is a single medication that has literally no possible side effects. Even water can have side effects! So, I'm certain that a chemically mind altering medication of course has side effects. That psychiatrist also insisted that I shouldn't look up or research any of my medications. This is one of many, many examples of my bad experiences with psychiatrists.

I say all that to say, continue to advocate for, and educate yourself as much as possible. Believe in your own experiences and trust yourself. If you feel a certain way, explore it and ask questions. Trying to find solutions on your own at times also can help. Psychiatrists nor any Dr. or professional is all knowing. As my mom says ""Doctors are not God"".

I was the insecure person, we had many quarrels in our relationship of around 15 months... Before the break up we spent some good time, I was getting secure, and suddenly a day came all I thought was shattered....

So they used to tell in College that their father is a businessman, they have audi, a big house, lots of money to use... All of this, they used to pay my bills many times with the promise of returning it when I'll ne able to pay them back ( still they were not big amounts separately)... Besides, they had some physical problems like heart problem, had some surgeries and 2-3 more medical problems...

I've never visited their house nor their parents, I used to locate their house by their address on Google maps, but I never succeed... Previously I've asked them to show me... But they never did.... And still my curiosity was not allowing me to... And at the end I asked, pleas tell me, where's your House, I want to see... And they were like, Look! My father had a big lost in his business and we had to move to the older house... He sold all her assets, now we're living a normal life (I never had problems with social or economical backgrounds)...

And I was like okay, but deep down I couldn't make sense of this, it was impossible to face that big loss in business, I did all the calculations, they had many more claims like they had several pets at home, macbook....


But all these were lies.... So what was the real situation here? They later told me (after break-up, I couldn't trust their words anymore) that these were all due to their imagination, they mixed reality with imagination.



There are many big lies, like their twin who died in accident, and even one of their friend claimed that they have met/or talked on a call with their twin.... Their medical problems were lies, their fathers toxic behaviour didn't seemed appropriate to their character in their description, I've seen one of his video, and one more their real sibling, they told that they are adopted, when their twin sibling died with their uncle and aunt... They adopted their child...

today a similar thing happened it wasn’t a déjà vu, but I filled my brain going to that state of mind almost. I could recognize people around me and everything but again the document I was working on, I couldn’t recognize the text anymore. The messages I had sent seemed foreign. 
Luckily, I realized and recognized that this was the same thing that happened to me five years ago, so it helped me out. I started to re-track my steps and it helped me snap out of it in just a couple of minutes.

Both times I was working on my laptop and there were people talking around, I was also interacting with them slightly. Both times I’d say I was doing a very monotone work (re-writing a text, entering data into excel).

1jqgulo,mentalhealth,1743682524.0,"Does anyone have tips for not feeling so guilty for taking a break? (CW for very mild suicidal mention) Hello, I hope this is a good place for this question. 

I am 22 years old in my 4th year of university with a depression that has gradually gotten worse over the years. It got to a point where I could barely scrape by with studying for as little as 30 minutes a day basically, when before I would always force myself to study for 7-9 hours. I think I kind of started off with too much force, and then tried to power through because I could not deal with feeling like I was doing ""too little"" studying you know. Each semester I felt like I started with less and less energy, until I just could not do it anymore. 

I started to go to therapy and stuff for depression and anxiety, but it's really hard for me to be very honest there when I am used to keeping a lot of thoughts 100% private for almost 10 years in some cases. 

Anyway I feel like I am at my wits end lately. I basically got forced to take a break from studies because of the way my degree is structured, so I don't really have any stress or obligations until next semester starts in August. In theory this was my greatest desire, to just be able to try and relax and work on my thoughts with no academic pressure on top of it. Last semester I really felt like I couldn't do it anymore to the point where my psychologist grilled me at the end of every session if there was any chance I would commit suicide before next week so she would have to put me in the hospital. 

The problem is I still can't feel any peace. I still wake up stressed, I still can't sleep, I can't feel happy doing anything, I'm not interested in any of my hobbies even if I have all the time in the world. I feel like I am failing everyone and myself by taking a break. As soon as I wake up I can't just make breakfast and relax by watching a TV show, but I have to force myself to go for a 10-13 km run and then feel completely drained the rest of the day even if it's still 10am. The weather has been sunny the last few days, and I just sit inside paralysed because I feel like I have to go out and enjoy the sun even if it's cold and I don't really want to. 

What is this phenomenon? Why can't I just relax for once? This state has me feeling more suicidal than ever because it feels like even when there are no responsibilites or obligations, life is still just a painful blur and I still dread waking up every morning ... I can't seem to empty my mind. It's like a constant dread and anxiety like I am running out of time and not doing enough, but there is nothing pressing I have to do. And when I try doing things I would enjoy in the past, like reading or playing video games, I just feel so bad and stressed like I am wasting time. But my psychologist says I should focus on doing things like that because she believes I will just automatically feel good again after a while.

Please let me know if anyone has felt stuck like this before and have any tips on how to kind of turn off the constant thoughts maybe?",anyone tips feeling guilty taking break cw mild suicidal mention hello hope good place question years old th year university depression gradually gotten worse years got point could barely scrape studying little minutes day basically would always force study hours think kind started much force tried power could deal feeling like little studying know semester felt like started less less energy could anymore started go therapy stuff depression anxiety really hard honest used keeping lot thoughts private almost years cases anyway feel like wits end lately basically got forced take break studies way degree structured dont really stress obligations next semester starts august theory greatest desire able try relax work thoughts academic pressure top last semester really felt like couldnt anymore point psychologist grilled end every session chance would commit suicide next week would put hospital problem still cant feel peace still wake stressed still cant sleep cant feel happy anything im interested hobbies even time world feel like failing everyone taking break soon wake cant make breakfast relax watching tv show force go km run feel completely drained rest day even still weather sunny last days sit inside paralysed feel like go enjoy sun even cold dont really want phenomenon cant relax state feeling suicidal ever feels like even responsibilites obligations life still painful blur still dread waking every morning cant seem empty mind like constant dread anxiety like running time enough nothing pressing try things would enjoy past like reading playing video games feel bad stressed like wasting time psychologist says focus things like believes automatically feel good please let know anyone felt stuck like tips kind turn constant thoughts maybe,0,1,Positive,High Risk

1jqaxnj,mentalhealth,1743660431.0,"I'm not scared to die anymore 19F here, and lately, I just don’t see a way out. Suicide has been on my mind more and more. I keep thinking about what it would be like to hang myself, how my family would react, if anyone would even care. I used to think things would get better, but they haven’t. If anything, they’ve only gotten worse.  

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14, then bipolar disorder at 18. I honestly can’t even remember the last time I felt happy. I don't even remember what it's like to feel normal. and to top it off, I'm alcoholic. Drinking is literally the only time I feel normal, like an actual person who wants to live. It’s the only time I can smile, cry, or feel anything at all. When I’m sober, I’m just numb, and I hate it. I remember when I was younger and saw what drinking did to my dad, and how it killed him, I promised myself that I wouldn’t end up like him. But when I got drunk for the first time, I got why he did. And I hate that I get it. I wish I never knew the feeling of getting drunk, because now I feel like I can't stop.

I also don’t really have friends anymore. The only time I leave the house is for college, and even though I have good grades, it doesn’t mean anything to me. I don’t even know if I have a future. My drinking is getting worse, my memory is going to shit, and I feel like I’m losing the person I used to be. I used to have so much potential. Younger me would be terrified of who shes become. I can’t stop wondering where I messed up, when things could have gone differently, and who I
could’ve been. 

And on top of everything, I hate myself. I hate how I look, how I act, how I am. I feel like a monster. I feel like I'm someone who was never meant to be happy or loved. It’s like no matter what I do, I’ll always be this broken

Okay, maybe I’ve been struggling for a few years now but 27 feels like that part in a movie that the entirety of it has lead up to and now you’re at the edge of your seat in anticipation. That’s how I feel at least. From the outside, I probably seem to have it all figured out. I have a good paying job, I’m happy with my career choice, I just got engaged, I have good friends. And yet, I still find happiness eluding me. I’ve never been one to put a lot of stock in how the material world perceives me or how people perceive me in general. I’m okay with who I am. I’m confident in this skin but I still can’t shake this feeling of uncertainty. It’s gotten way worse since my birthday. Most days I wake up with a dark cloud over me and I go to bed with it still there. Don’t get me wrong, some days the dark cloud lets a little sunshine through but that’s just it, it’s still there. I never get the full scope of the sun shining on my skin. It’s always overcast. If we’re being honest, it’s starting to lead me towards thoughts of suicide. Not that I’m seriously considering it or that I haven’t struggled with these thoughts in the past but this feels different. Under normal circumstances, something inconvenient will happen in my life (i.e. death of a close one) and I’ll get very sad and then it gets better. You know, the normal stuff. This year though, unlike anything I’ve really experienced before. It’s like all these good things are happening to me and yet, I still feel shitty inside. It’s driving me crazy because I’m aware enough to realize that there’s people on this planet that have it WAYYY harder than I do. There’s people suffering everywhere and here I am throwing myself a pity party over god knows what. It doesn’t make any sense but here I am. I find myself waking up every morning and throwing a costume on because it’s easier to pretend than to explain this awful feeling. Again, I’m not here to talk about how I hate my life or how I want to die. It’s just very foreign to me to have things going my way and still feel bummed inside. Is it always this hard? Does it get better? I just don’t know how much longer I can keep up the facade before I have to explain this thing I’m feeling. I’ve tried talking to my fiancée about this but I just get the run of the mill advice you can slap on most instances. I realize I sound very ungrateful but the advice really doesn’t make me feel any better. More often than not I find myself just agreeing with her just so I don’t have to speak out loud about it anymore. And my parents, forget about it. They’re not equipped to deal with something like this. My father is quick to dismiss any sort of mental health related conversations and my mother will just advise me to go see a professional.

1jq97b6,mentalhealth,1743654232.0,"How do I feel something again >For context:  
I'm an eighth grader in India and feel like throwing my life away. I lost my father at 7 and buried my emotions deep down to be strong for my mom and sister. Now, all I feel is gray; there is no one in my life who I can share this with, so I am putting it on Reddit to get some advice.

I feel like throwing my life away because I am worthless. I am not great academically, with 92% in my grades, which is useless. I can't focus on anything and hate studying because I feel like even if I start now, everyone is already ahead of me, and I will never catch up.

My mom wants me to be the best and I always feel pressured. I am talking about having a mental breakdown at losing 2 marks in a maths test and contemplating suicide if I get anything less than a 90%. I attach most of my self-worth to my grades and don't tell my mother about my grades if I get anything less than 100%.

I am the second youngest in my extended family, and due to being a gifted child as a kid (now burnt out, thanks to school), my family has high expectations for me. My older cousins are in college, and the cousin closest to my age is also in the eighth grade. She is my biggest competition, I feel worthless looking at her achievements.

I want to hate my mom, but can't because of how much she does for me. I feel like I am in constant debt to her and if I can't repay her, I fail. She is bitter about how her life turned out and often complains about it. I can't stand listening to her go on and on about how bad her life is. She views me as a vessel to achieve all the things that she wants and not as a person. My mom's side is extremely dismissive of us children. My oldest cousins have cut them off, and I am thinking of doing the same. I am not close to my father's side and feel like I am alone in this world.

My school is extremely competitive and makes a big deal out of grades. I don't have friends who care.

I have so much anger and sadness, I feel like a dam that is going to burst, and when I try to cry, I just can't because I've buried my emotions so deep that I don't feel anything anymore and just smile because that is all I know. And I am tired of being sympathetic with others

1jq83w7,mentalhealth,1743650741.0,"How to trust myself again after self harming? This is something I desperately need advice on and something I can’t find advice for anywhere. People don’t seem to talk about the fact that once you self harm for the first time everything completely changes. I think when I first did it my brains sort of went into a dissociative shock because we are naturally wired to want to avoid pain and injury and to value our lives but somehow my mind got to the point where I literally sat down and actively made the choice to cut my own skin.

I am past this now, it happened during the roughest time of my life and I didn’t do it much but while not taking my anti-depressants properly I burnt myself really badly with a cigarette which has left a nasty scar and I cut my arm up for the first time in the same day (I had previously self harmed by cutting the tops of my fingers before). It was such a painful time and I’m not 100% sure why I did it. When I cut my fingers I think that was because I was annoyed at myself and wanted the marks to remind me how badly I want to change the way I am. And the cigarette was just because I hated myself so I didn’t care what happened to me, and then when I cut my arm up that was after I suddenly stopped taking my antidepressants and I was super drunk so I don’t have much memory but I genuinely think it was a desperate attempt to not commit suicide because I felt so pathetic and like the biggest loser ever and that the only thing I could do was attempt to release the pain by cutting or kill myself. Luckily I didn’t die and I am very very happy I didn’t kms.

I am in a very different place now but I worry that my brain will never be the same since self harming because the chemistry has changed or something and I can’t perceive emotions as well as before. An example though is how before I ever self harmed or even considered the possibility of doing it if I even thought about somebody self harming it would make me feel sick and horrified like a normal person, nowadays though I feel nothing towards it.

My main problem is I feel like I have killed my inner child. The younger me feels like they have died now, I can’t believe I did this to myself. I have so much guilt, I even hate myself for self harming. I feel like I can never be truly happy again because I am someone who has self harmed which is pretty much the worst thing somebody could do to themselves apart from commit suicide I guess. I feel lonely. I feel unsafe with myself. How can I learn to trust myself again? To trust the person that hurt me, the person that hated me so much to do something I would never imagine doing to anyone except myself, I feel like a monster to myself. How could I do this to myself. I was doing my best, all my problems weren’t my fault they were normal self confidence problems and self control problems because of ADHD and somehow it led to sever delusion and body dysmorphia and self hate which then led to me cutting my own skin.

I need someone to help me believe that I can leave this in the past and see it as just a part of my life. I need help believing that my brain is not permanently fucked because of this. I am 100% confident I will never relapse again but I feel like the damage has been done and I feel unimaginable amounts of pain for the poor innocent happy child in me that thrived before people made me feel like a loser and I started hating the things that made me who I am.

I have hurt too many people because of my stupid mistakes, and they forever haunt me Hello, everyone. This is my current account, since my old account ran into trouble on a few subreddits due to inappropriate behaviour. I’m a 16-year-old boy from the Netherlands, but my life has been completely ruined. This was not only my fault, but it was also because of other annoying people I’ve faced in the last few years, especially demonic trolls.

I’ll admit, I’ve made plenty of stupid mistakes when I confronted these trolls. I told lies about them and threatened them, but these trolls treated those as horrible crimes. They made fun of me and called me things like ‘jit’ and ‘lil bro’. I was deeply offended and shocked by those terms, and they made me even angrier. But some of these managed to report me, leading to a few temporary bans on Reddit.

In addition to that, I also have numerous problems in real life. I have a strained relationship with my two brothers. My older brother likes to bully me and call me nasty things, whereas my younger brother is much more socially successful and athletic than me. I feel like a lonely social wreck, and my brothers are more successful in life than me. I also feel like I look much uglier and more emasculated compared to them. My parents also treat me much more like a little kid compared to them.

I’m often scared to meet and talk to a new person my age. I’m afraid they’ll troll me. I’m in Gen Z, but I don’t have many online friends who are part of that generation. Most of my online friends are Millennials, and I’m not happy with my generation’s culture. When I look at the Internet 20 years ago, I feel like it was much less toxic and more friendly than it is now. It was less complicated, and I feel like I missed out on it. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts and even want to kill myself so I could be reborn in the late 80s/early 90s and experience more of the ‘good’ Internet, even though not everyone believes in the theory of reincarnation into the past being possible.

1jqisu9,mentalhealth,1743687800.0,"Ami overreacting or does this therapist not seem interested? I’ve been searching for a therapist since September 2024. It’s now April 2025. I’ve contacted dozens. Either they weren’t taking new clients, ghosted me, or just didn’t follow through. My aunt (a therapist herself) couldn’t find anyone either. Even people she knew personally never responded. It’s been exhausting.

I recently reached out to a therapist (let’s call her Mira) through Psychology Today. In my initial message, I mentioned that two professionals recommended her and asked if she wanted to talk first or hear more about what I was hoping to work on. She replied quickly saying she had one or two openings and told me to call the office to see if I was a good fit and if so they would schedule me. Isn’t that the therapists job? To see if we’d be a good fit? I tried calling. No one answered.

So I emailed her back and mentioned that I used to see someone in her practice (we’ll call that person Lena, a therapist I previously worked with) and should still be in the system. Mira replied that she’d email the office for me.

I followed up with: “I’m curious about your experience with C-PTSD. Is that something you work with?”

She said yes, she has clients with C-PTSD and works with trauma, attachment issues, etc. But then added that because she hadn’t assessed my eating disorder, she couldn’t say whether outpatient was appropriate. She explained how trauma and EDs often require different levels of care, and if someone is physically at risk, she wouldn’t process trauma without medical coordination. (Fair, I guess.)

She offered to still meet people where they’re at if they’re working with a dietitian. But then at the end of her email, she listed two referrals, and basically said, “If you’re not comfortable with this, I understand. I wish you the best if we don’t meet.” Felt like a soft “no thanks.”

So here’s where I’m stuck. I didn’t even mention my ED until after asking if she worked with C-PTSD. I clarified it’s atypical anorexia—meaning I’m not underweight. I was not asking for ED treatment right now, and I even said I’m not ready to work on it yet. I just wanted trauma support. And honestly, I’m tired of feeling like I have to hide that I have an ED to be taken seriously.

Even my aunt, who’s a licensed therapist, hasn’t been able to help me find anyone who can help. And yeah, part of me wonders if Mira ended up calling my former therapist, Lena, after I mentioned being her former patient.

So… am I overthinking this? Was Mira being cautious or just brushing me off? Should I have kept the ED info to myself? Or did she just not want to work with me in the first place? I’m confused as to why she didn’t ask what I was looking for when I offered to talk to her about it.",ami overreacting therapist seem interested ive searching therapist since september april ive contacted dozens either werent taking new clients ghosted didnt follow aunt therapist couldnt find anyone either even people knew personally never responded exhausting recently reached therapist lets call mira psychology today initial message mentioned two professionals recommended asked wanted talk first hear hoping work replied quickly saying one two openings told call office see good fit would schedule isnt therapists job see wed good fit tried calling one answered emailed back mentioned used see someone practice well call person lena therapist previously worked still system mira replied shed email office followed im curious experience cptsd something work said yes clients cptsd works trauma attachment issues etc added hadnt assessed eating disorder couldnt say whether outpatient appropriate explained trauma eds often require different levels care someone physically risk wouldnt process trauma without medical coordination fair guess offered still meet people theyre theyre working dietitian end email listed two referrals basically said youre comfortable understand wish best dont meet felt like soft thanks heres im stuck didnt even mention ed asking worked cptsd clarified atypical anorexiameaning im underweight asking ed treatment right even said im ready work yet wanted trauma support honestly im tired feeling like hide ed taken seriously even aunt whos licensed therapist hasnt able help find anyone help yeah part wonders mira ended calling former therapist lena mentioned former patient overthinking mira cautious brushing kept ed info want work first place im confused didnt ask looking offered talk,3,2,Positive,Low Concern

One daily habit that has significantly improved my mental well-being is setting boundaries with my phone usage. I used to spend hours scrolling through social media, checking notifications constantly, and feeling overwhelmed by endless information. Over time, I realized that my excessive phone use was draining my energy, increasing my anxiety, and affecting my sleep.

To regain control, I started setting screen time limits and designating ""no-phone zones"", especially in the morning and before bed. Now, I avoid checking my phone right after waking up, allowing myself to start the day with a clear mind instead of diving into social media or emails. Before bedtime, I put my phone away at least an hour before sleeping, which has improved my sleep quality and reduced late-night overthinking.

I also use app blockers to limit time spent on distracting apps and turn off unnecessary notifications to minimize digital distractions. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I’ve replaced that habit with reading, journaling, or simply being present in the moment.

To help me stay accountable, I use the Jolt app ([link here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jolt-screen-time-control/id6738301540)), which helps me track my screen time and control app usage.

1jqfzbq,mentalhealth,1743679875.0,"I(20) just Experienced the most soul crushing breakup with my then bf(20) to the point that I can’t do basic tasks and even enjoy my life anymore 
I F(20) Experienced my first ever breakup with my BF(20). Please someone help me I don’t know what to do with my life anymore…

(Im sorry my English is not good, i just need to let this one out)

Me and my bf started dating when I we were still 18. Both of us are artists he’s the performing artist while I’m the visual artist. Our relationship wasn’t perfect, we had personal issues. At first I was the avoidant-anxious to him but I’ve grown from it and learned to fully embrace him. However, when I was no longer avoidant just anxious, he’s the one who became avoidant. Avoidant when it comes to confrontation of feelings because he grew from a family where all his emotional needs were dismissed. 

So our problem and conflict rooted from me wanting to talk about our arguments and fixing it immediately while he needs space to think before talking about it. It ha become a problem for a while but we soon learned to adapt to each other… He learned to somehow give me assurance that we will talk about our problems soon, and I learned that solving problems doesn’t require immediate solutions. We survived the hell of multiple breakup threats through our relationship.

That is until, he realized something. He started to have an existential crisis, for context my ex was a lively man, he enjoys living his life the fullest with freedom, he’s a metalhead, a goth, he has 2 bands. He loves doing what he enjoys. Somehow when he started to realize that we’re really growing up to the seriousness of age, he realized that he still wants to live his life more without the commitment of a relationship to think about.

Despite realizing that, he stayed. He stayed long despite the arising guilt of missing his single life and the reason for that is because… he pitied me. He told me in those 2 years he still loved me but ever since he realized that he still wants to do more in his life, he stayed out of the pity that if he revealed that news to me I would be deeply hurt and heartbroken because he knew that he was my first… everything.

All the times we share love and affection to each other he said that it was still out of pure love. But his pity for me outweighed the love he had for me. He also said that it was because he didn’t expect for us to last this long, his past relationship only lasted a few months at best. So this was his first long-term relationship. When we started dating we made it clear to each other that we both date to marry, that weren’t casual daters for fun. But right now he realizes that we’re moving too fast for a relationship. He then realized that he didn’t like the idea of already being committed this young and no longer having to live his life the fullest.

The door that leads into the main hallway from my bedroom is extremely thin & is across from the laundry room so I constantly hear the beeping of the machines and ppl passing to get to the elevator.

How it’s effecting my academics & mental heath: I’m taking 13 credits and am working on two senior projects.

I’m in my last year of university (I am studying two degrees at the same time in one of the most important university of my country, maths and physics, which is something I should be proud of and I love it but I only feel meh about it) planning doing a master to become a researcher in mathematical physics and then doing a PhD but I don’t feel good enough to do it.

Indeed I celebrate my birthday last weekend (24m) and I didn’t feel so happy, everyone came with many presents and were so happy (including my fuckbuddy, who gave me a present too). Honestly, I was a bit down. I don’t know if it was because I like my fuckbuddy and he didnt like me back or about I’m insecure of what master I’m gonna get into (I sent many applications and I got in a very prestigious one, but not my first option, I would know my first option in July) or about not reconnecting with my hobbies (I’m very curious guy and I want to learn so many things so I spent so many hours in Wikipedia when I was a kid but not this last years).

One thing I feel is that I lost my personality. Now I am completely different guy (I go to the gym, i am sociable blablabla) but I miss being a nerd knowing things and being a weirdo (some friends told me that I am still with books and films and some art things)

1jqah4o,mentalhealth,1743658735.0,"Mama HELP💜 (if people who are diagnosed with anything could read this thank you so much) Uhm, so I don’t expect anyone to really answer this and I’m aware this is more so venting then it is a question but I don’t know. I’ve never used Reddit before, I made an account four years ago and I never used it. But recently I’ve been going down a spiral.
I fear that I may have some type of mental illness or disorder or something but my parents don’t think I do and aren’t too keen on helping me, and I’ve tried talking to someone or trying to find someone but nothing goes according to plan and it all ends up turning out as a mess. 

Recently my mood changes have been very very drastic and sudden and I feel like my emotions are controlling me more so than I am controlling them. I recently relapsed in terms of sh after months of being clean. I’ve also been much more irritated with everyone around me and I’ve found when I’m upset that I just thinking of every single bad thing they’ve done and I just begin to spiral about how much I hate them and I have all these terrible thoughts about them even if I don’t actually hate them. 
Along with the irritation-I’ve been feeling as if I’m ruining my relationships because of it, but I’m so genuinely terrified of losing my friends and those who are close to me to the point I’m having panic attacks and feel so insanely nauseous. I feel like a husk, if anything, I feel like there’s nothing inside of me and that nothing is real-i don’t have high hopes for the future-and all my days feel the same, I feel like I’m stuck and that I’m going crazy. 

Again, don’t know if anyone will read this but please, if there is anyone who’s diagnosed with something or who have felt something similar as much just help me out. I don’t know what to do with myself and if I need to look into anything specific. I’m just so overwhelmed.

1jqa2im,mentalhealth,1743657268.0,"Tired of it all… 28M with ADHD, depression, and social anxiety. It’s a combo that kills people. I’m a big tall and often friendly dude but it’s the biggest lie in the world. It’s all a mask cause while I kinda hate the world I don’t gotta make it a worse place, folk deserve better. Anywho it’s given me fantastic people skills but I hate dealing with them. Turned me into a fantastic liar I guess (if I didn’t have a conscious id be a politician or lawyer lol)

I’ve done labor I’ve done bartending I’ve been a cashier and clerk and warehouse worker. I even did security being a bigger guy and all. Nothing sticks for long and I’m plagued with financial instability (actually 4k in credit card debt currently- and I live super frugal too and do everything to cut costs)

I just can’t keep up the mask and the tasks that long, usually 6-18 months or so.

Worst part is it’s not just jobs, it’s friends and hobbies. I’ve probably met a hundred new people in the past decade who I had a genuine good time being around and I always ghost them in the end. When I’m not forced to be around you I’m just not going to talk to you it feels like more work

They all say you have to find what you enjoy doing- and I get you don’t have to completely love it but that’s the problem. There’s just nothing that interests me or that I’m good at I can see myself doing in the long term.

In and out of therapy whole life which has never really helped, currently on Wellbutrin (apparent I’m one of the 3 people it kinda works for lol)

I’ve had the bad bad bad thoughts since I was 7 years old. If this is what life is, I just don’t want it. I don’t want a future I don’t want a family I don’t even really want a lot of money or a career but I need that to survive 

I’ve broken 13 bones, dropped out of college, and my longest relationship cheated on me. And capped out a couple years ago at 300lbs (actually lost 60lbs and am going to keep going down but it hasn’t made me feel any better, just pissed I let it get so bad in the first place.) My entire 20s have been miserable, hell my teens weren’t great either

Trying to do art or music just makes me want to physically trash my entire apartment, I know these things take practice but last time I tried to draw I clenched my teeth so hard I chipped a tooth. Tried teaching myself guitar and in just my first couple days I had an entire episode and drank myself to sleep for a month straight (thank goodness I’m a happy drunk). Apparently I’m a half decent writer but I hate everything I’ve ever made- even if people like it I get weirdly angry and depressed and have to leave

That’s nothing thing: even though I put out positivity into the world, I outright despise receiving it. Being celebrated makes me want to disappear forever.

I’m just… done. Even Accomplishing short term goals does nothing for cause of the adhd.

So to hell with it, I hope you all accomplish your dreams! Find your paths! And make the most of it all!

1jr78fc,depression,1743756399.0,"Taking a break from depressed friend I just said I needed a break from my close friend with depression.
A lot of things have happened relentlessly, one after the other, without much space for me to recover properly. I'm burnt out in this relationship. 

My friend and I very close, essentially best friends, and love talking to each other. He struggles immensely with a myriad of things - depression, OCD, anxiety, PTSD. He has in the 4-5 years of knowing him. He's intermittedly gone in and out of depression holes. In the earlier years he's struggled with self harm and a suicide attempt. It's been consistently taxing on me, where each phase he goes through is another better but still unstable place. Especially in the last couple of years since he came back from travelling, he's been really lost with who he is and what he wants to do. Currently he's been unemployed for 3 months and struggling to find energy to get a job or even just do the basics sometimes.

Between his on and off again attempts at living and turning into a blob, and my anxiety, it's all excruciating. I'm sick of constantly reckoning with the fact that he might leave (I think this is partly my anxiety, but there's also been a history of his disappearing for days to a week. He's been getting better but it's still not enough). Regardless of the rationality of the threat, it feels like a constant threat hanging over me nonetheless. And to be honest, I don't have faith anymore that he will be able to get to a decent place. Or at least I'm so burnt out that I don't have the energy to. I don't have faith that he won't leave. I don't have any reserves of hope for his future. It's just not something my body is able to believe in right now.

I'm frustrated that my pain is not able to be voiced or done anything about to him. I know support for supporting him shouldn't come from him, and I'd obviously never say these things to his face, but it aggravates me that all this suffering won't be seen by him when he's partly to ""blame"" for it. It feels like I just have to sit in my anxiety mostly by myself, like sitting in mud, alone. That this is my burden and nothing can really be done about it. It's just a bad situation mixed with my own abandonment issues.

I'm disappointed that I've failed to keep my own boundaries and protect myself. I thought I was getting better but I've still managed to get to this place, making the same core mistake that I've done in the past of overextending and not being careful enough with my energy. I feel like I won't be able to healthily be there for him any time in the near future, but I'm trying not to think about that right now.

Sorry this was a bit of a rant and emotional dump, but in other news and in terms of what I can control and give to myself - I'm trying to talk more about my own suffering and through my own experience of anxiety and abandonment feelings to friends and on here. I'm going to just take the time to relax and bring it back to my own foundations and not have to worry about supporting or something happening. It's also a good space to reanalyse and realise mistakes and what is misaligned in my own perception.

I hope this is the start of properly doing better for myself.

Please don't tell me that ""people come and go"" and ""you'll make other friends"" and ""that's life"" and ""i should move on"" and things like that, i've heard them already and my heart can't take it.

i (22F) am in my final year of college. I've met my roommate (22NB, let's call them Kat) in my first year, when we were randomly assigned, and we've been roommates for 4 years now. And these have been the best 4 years of my life, because of them. And i love all their little quirks, and i love recognizing their footstept when they're coming home, and i love listening to music with them, and talking about stupid things, and i love hearing them laugh, and i love choosing the bathroom soap with them, and i love when they're excited to tell me about something, and i love storing our shoes next to eachother..

But we're graduating, and it's all gone. We have 2 other roommates (randomly assigned this year) who made this last year a living hell: slamming the doors when we're sleeping, not talking to us, bringing people over without asking, waking us up each night and early in the morning..
And my roommate has had enough, and they're spending most of their time in their hometown, and when they're here they're sad all the time and i don't know how to help. I fear i can't do anything to help. 

And Kat has started packing their things, and now their part of the room is emptier. And it gets emptier and emptier. And they're gone for longer and longer. And i'm left with the ghost of them.

They don't want to stay in this city anymore. I'm not sure they want to stay in this country. We won't be roommates anymore. We won't see each other anymore. And i fear this is the last time i'm going to see them.

And i'm heartbroken, and i can't eat, and i go to sleep crying and i wake up crying. Thank god i can work remotely, because i've been crying during meetings, too. 
I wish there was a way to turn back the time, to find a way to fix this. Or at least to enjoy the good moments more than i did at the time. I wish i didn't take it for granted. I wish i tried more.

1jr3piq,depression,1743741858.0,"Been rejected for over 8 years Got cheated on my first relationship back when I was 19. Apart from that she always use to play games to test me which fucked up my mental health during the relationship. I’ve been trying ever since but I am always very cautious about it amounted the mountain of trust issues, but I keep getting rejected and friend zoned. 

TLDR I am 27 now, and also recently got rejected by a colleague, which was harsh and gave me panic attack for work misbehaviour allegations. Just to give context here is what happened.

I never looked at her in that way but were very good colleagues inside work. Lately since last year we were actively talking with each other on social media as well, but it was all friendly. We share the same level dark humour and brainrot memes. All friendly. This year I dont know what happened. I would catch her looking at me in pantry and when I look back she would look away immediately and smirk in a shy way. She is supper introverted, just like me. But I didn’t think much of it, as I myself was not looking for anything. Suddenly out of know where she tried to make some plans with me specifically after office over the weekend, which I refused with an excuse got some work over the weekend. She would again raise that when we were chatting and exchanging reels the other day, i said I can go. But I never followed up on it, as I was also not interested that much. Then we had an offsite where we would talk, and she randomly takes the conversations to deep personal level which involves her family and for some reason it also went to her anxiety about dating, and also share yes I have the same anxiety. And yes something was not right, I know I was over reading, maybe I suddenly might have developed an interest. After that I decided let’s give it try reinitiate the weekend plan she pitched before, but for some other reasons we agreed it was not possible during that day, so she offered to cook some food and send over instead. I found that so sweet, no one has ever done that to me in my life 😭 so I mildly suggest that i could come over since we lived reasonably close by, but then I side tracked and said that might not be possible because I have some work and not sure whether I can make it. She said it would be better if I can come over. I said I’ll confirm. So after 6 hours I confirmed. I was terrible confused what going on here. Am I misleading her? So I consulted a friend about the entire situation, the key thing she said a women trusts me enough that she invited me over dinner and it might be a good sign, but don’t go in with expectations. So I go over with no expectations, the moment u arrived she starts pestering me with food wtf 😭 why tf is she so sweet to me, I said you don’t want me to eat alone so she accompanied. We were talking and talking, her being her introverted self and shy, somehow ended up in conversation, where I told her she sings great (she was singing every now and then), to which I made a joke to not make the complement sound weird of too rushed “I used to sing as well, but that only due to my break up 😭”, too which she pressed and asked when was the last breakup, after I answered she started talking about her last breakup which causes her anxiety to date. Rest of the night went well, I tried leaving earlier but she insisted on staying a bit, then I fucked off. 

The next day, I was so anxious, I consulted my friend again, she suggested I should get to obviously no her more, because even I had the anxiety of dating that force myself not indulge further. I decided that was it, let her advance further if needed. But my friend said I should probably invite her over coffee after office sometime. So I texted her “hey yesterday was fun! There is a new cafe that opened near office would like to go and check it out once, would you be interested to join over coffee?” To which she replied are you asking casually or are you asking me over a date? I got a bit nervous as this was not loooking good. So I gave a bit diplomatic response “don’t get me wrong, really like talking yesterday and that’s why wanted to hangout after coffee”, to which she gave a really formal response, she said thanks for letting her know, and she really appreciates the invite, but she does not think it’s appropriate. Holy fuck. What the fuck have i done. To do damage control I replied “thanks for letting me know! I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable, good night!”, she just replied “not at all! Goodnight!”

Ever since then i haven’t initiated any conversations with her outside work even in social media. At work she seemed normal like before. But I have been on constant anxiety if this escalates to management, or if she talks about this to other colleagues that would have my face loss. I have learned my lesson.  Never shit where you eat. 

It’s just disheartening that over the last 8 years no one has ever said yes, which has affected my self image. At this point I have decided to live alone and financially be prepared for that as well.

1jr3k9a,depression,1743741341.0,"I absolutely hate my life right now March was a rough month. I was laid off from my job in preparation for tariffs. I finally had a job where I wasnt paycheck to paycheck and enjoyed what I did. A week later I had an accident leaving me with a broken jaw, 3 messed up teeth, and nerve damage. No insurance or income. 

I refuse to pull my teeth, they’re in the front. They can be saved with root canals and crowns. But I can’t eat and barely talk, which is mostly from my jaw.

I was offered a job. A 33,000 pay cut, but I get insurance right away. And I absolutely hate it. I’ve had another job offer, something I’d be happy with and the same pay, but wouldn’t have insurance for 3 months. And right now I desperately need insurance. So I took the dreaded job. 9 hours of my day I’m absolutely miserable. I can barely talk, but being in customer service I have to. I haven’t eaten in 2 weeks, just protein shakes and ensure. Doctor gave me vitamins that make me so sick every day. I’m constantly in pain all day. I started door dashing, so when I’m not working I’m dashing. Currently working about 16 hours a day, and truth be told I’m still so far off from being able to afford my medical care.

With insurance I still need to come up with 6000 for my jaw. My teeth, I can get done at dental school for right over $1300 plus crowns compared to $6700 through actual dentist. 

I’m defeated. There’s no light. I hate my job. I’m constantly in pain and sick to my stomach from all the meds I’m on. I’m not suicidal, but I’ve never wanted to be put out of my misery so badly before. 

There’s no family to fall on. Parents don’t support my life and cut me off years ago. I was denied care credit. I can’t commit to paying back a loan. Can’t sell my plasma, because I need that right now.

Cost of living is insane. I've been an addict since I was 18, 3 years in recovery now, with a long stretch of sobriety. I thought things were getting better, I started to take care of my mental and physical health more. Getting used to the fact I don't need to bottle my emotions up or numb myself with my addiction.

I got fired from my Job today and I'm just tired. I feel like if been trying to walk up the down escalator my entire life. I didn't relapse, I made it through the day sober but I keep thinking of the fact that, if Death were to visit me and tell me ""it's time"" I wouldn't hesitate to go. I realize sometimes like today, Aside from my two loving parents, I have nobody, I could disappear and nobody would notice or care. I haven't and won't do anything to myself because it would destroy my parents. But I'm tired of being life's punching bag. I don't think I can do this for the rest of my life.

My parents are the only thing keeping me here, and it was sad today, I told them, for the first time after the day they're gone. I don't think i'll be around much longer.

I don't feel like doing anything to myself, or relapsing in my addiction. all of that requires energy, and I'm just tired. I'm tired of everything, of life never improving, life seemingly getting worse, more alone as the years go by and I lie to myself at my 12 step meeting saying im fine, im doing better.

1jr2ejp,depression,1743737409.0,"I deserve everything bad that happens to me. I’m 25 and my life has been nothing but a series of unfortunate events. I’ve blocked out most of my life starting from age 1 to probably 22. At least so far.

There have only been maybe a small handful of times I’ve ever been happy. 

My motto is “fake it till you make it” but I can’t do that with my happiness. 

I’ll never be happy. Everything and everyone I ruin. 

I had what I thought was the perfect relationship and I ruined it because I’m depressed and anxious all the time. Yesterday, he let his coworkers steal his cellphone and harass me for several hours while I went into a full nervous breakdown. I deserved it. 
 
Everything in my life just goes wrong. I deserve it all. I’m probably the shittiest human to walk to earth. 

Everyone hates me. I don’t know why but I probably deserve it. 

Where is the happiness at the other side? I’ve searched and searched and come up empty handed for 25 fucking years. When will I get my perfect ending? Never.

I have no friends, no support system, my parents tell me they love me but then turn around and tell me I’m a piece of shit and a failure. But, I deserve it.

Everywhere I go this curse follows me. It just must be what my fate is. 

No amount of SSRI’s and therapy will fix it. I probably take over 200mg of SSRI’s a day. Nothing. Just emptiness. 

I’m just a severely broken and traumatized person and that’s all I’ll ever amount too. 

There is no future for me. There is no one out there who will love me for me. There is no one out there who will be my friend. Everyone leaves. Or they forget about me. But I deserve it.

Every day is a living hell. I suffer in silence every day and I deserve every fucking second. 

People only love you unless you’re pretty, dying (or already gone), or famous. And I’m none of those. 

I don’t know why I’m a bad person but I know I am because everything/everyone leaves me or hurts me in the end. 

In the end, it’ll always just be me, myself and I endlessly suffering because I did something to deserve it.

1jr26dn,depression,1743736686.0,"I don't know what to do anymore To give detail, I am 16 years old and I am a cis gendered male. My entire life I have experienced nothing but hardships, and obviously that's nothing to cry over, everyone experiences difficulties. It's a part of life, but my struggles to me are major because of how sensitive I am to such things that aren't meant for an adolescent or child to experience so soon. 

I have ADHD, but this wasn't known until august of last year after I decided to get diagnosed. My entire life, I have had struggles functioning up to social standards, and with no surprise also academical standards. For the most part, I can remember growing up always feeling as if I was failing, or as if I was doing something wrong, as if something was wrong with me. I had behavior issues, difficulty focusing on my necessities and tasks. According to my teachers, I was a disobedient and misbehaving child who just needs to learn to sit still and pay attention more. But those such things weren't even of my control, my ADHD had been taking effect of almost everything in my life. Talking to my ADHD specialist about my childhood experience, she was saddened and surprisingly shocked to hear my fully detailed experience, and had mentioned on how she wondered how in the world no one detected the possibility of me having ADHD.

The effects of my ADHD took place up through all of elementary, middle school and even my freshman year. And I can remember every single detail, bad, good, painful, and even agonizing. Not to mention how my anxiety (which my psychiatrist diagnosed me) made everything so much worse for my mental health and performance. I had severe depression and still do unfortunately.

Another thing to add is how I was subject to so much trauma growing up. Memories of my mother abusing me because of my father's mistakes, and how they would argue and become violently constantly, or memories of my older siblings just getting into the worst altercations with my parents. There is so much I could tell but I want to spare the details to focus on how the main thing is, my trauma, life experience, mental illnesses have effected me so god damn severely in my life, and even after being medicated and trying to make myself better. Nothing feels like it's working.

I haven't cried in a month but today just sitting at my dining table watching the sunset, I cried remembering every single word that has been said to me, every single thought that kills me, and every single memory that made me miserable. 

I'm wondering when I'll finally live, not be a failure, not be so irritated towards others, or when I'll finally complete my homework when I need to. There's so much damn thought and desire that I have, I am just so tired, I am so tired of living and practically making my mental and physical healthy works with caffeine and nicotine, as well as isolating myself from everyone.

I have lost all joy in everything I do, I have lost every bit of interest or hope that I have of living well and normally. I want to commit self harm so badly, but I'm tired of being ridiculed and judged for it. I want to do so much, and I want so much to go away. I just want to know, when will everything get better??? 

When in the fuck will I finally be a normal human being and not be the way I am, I want to be someone new and I've been trying so hard, but yet even what I try hard is never enough, I want things to be fine, I want everything I could ever hope for from myself to actually happen.

I want to live. I want to live, that is all I want, because for the past 16 years of my damned life, I've been dead.",dont know anymore give detail years old cis gendered male entire life experienced nothing hardships obviously thats nothing cry everyone experiences difficulties part life struggles major sensitive things arent meant adolescent child experience soon adhd wasnt known august last year decided get diagnosed entire life struggles functioning social standards surprise also academical standards part remember growing always feeling failing something wrong something wrong behavior issues difficulty focusing necessities tasks according teachers disobedient misbehaving child needs learn sit still pay attention things werent even control adhd taking effect almost everything life talking adhd specialist childhood experience saddened surprisingly shocked hear fully detailed experience mentioned wondered world one detected possibility adhd effects adhd took place elementary middle school even freshman year remember every single detail bad good painful even agonizing mention anxiety psychiatrist diagnosed made everything much worse mental health performance severe depression still unfortunately another thing add subject much trauma growing memories mother abusing fathers mistakes would argue become violently constantly memories older siblings getting worst altercations parents much could tell want spare details focus main thing trauma life experience mental illnesses effected god damn severely life even medicated trying make better nothing feels like working havent cried month today sitting dining table watching sunset cried remembering every single word said every single thought kills every single memory made miserable im wondering ill finally live failure irritated towards others ill finally complete homework need theres much damn thought desire tired tired living practically making mental physical healthy works caffeine nicotine well isolating everyone lost joy everything lost every bit interest hope living well normally want commit self harm badly im tired ridiculed judged want much want much go away want know everything get better fuck finally normal human way want someone new ive trying hard yet even try hard never enough want things fine want everything could ever hope actually happen want live want live want past years damned life ive dead,0,1,Neutral,Low Concern

here’s where it sucks for me. I don’t feel like i’ve accomplished shit. everywhere it just feels condescending like people just look down at me.  I have deep and long relationships with friends but I still feel just an empty pit of loneliness. There’s been a couple of other events that i won’t get into but I’ve been through these depression episodes since 8th grade. this one has been going on for 7 months and it’s only been getting shittier. usually when i have these little depressive episodes they get better and better. i’ve asked for help before in 8th grade and 10th grade. 8th grade i got told i was a fucking liar basically and 10th grade therapy didn’t do shit for me. so I just sucked it up and kept it pushing solo. i’m trying to do that now but it’s not working and I don’t feel like reaching out for help because that is just being a burden and ungrateful to what i have. 

yes I do suffer from suicidal thoughts and have planned them out before. this has been going on since 8th grade as well. I just want to fucking die sometimes and now it’s becoming more of a daily thought.  whether that be through overdosing, jumping off a balcony, or having the most tragic shit happen to me. And logically it’s like i’m blessed too so there shouldn’t be shit to complain about as well. i don’t know how much longer i can think like this before i actually do something to myself.

1jr1mhu,depression,1743734923.0,"My chance of life was ruined Everyday every single day sometimes for hours I can't stop mourning the life I could've had.

I was smart, used to get As and Bs before highschool. I used to draw daily and I wanted to be a comic book artist. Reading books used to be my passion, I would read everyday and would still find time for other hobbies.

I hate my family for taking away the life I could've had. If it weren't for the abuse I wouldn't be suffering from Depression and PTSD. My anxiety is so bad that I constantly shake. After Covid is when it all went down hill, even when Covid settled down I refused to go back to school in person. It was such a a mistake. The isolation made my social anxiety worst. I was bed ridden for who knows how long, could've been a few months or even almost 2 years. I can't tell, I slept my life away, was too terrified to leave my room or even get from under my covers.

When I went back to school for my senior year, I had to spend most of my time in the counseling loft. Being around people would make me panic, I remember I burst out of the classroom crying. All my friends either moved schools or we no longer talked. I had only one person to talk to. I was so ashamed of being alone I refused to eat lunch in the cafeteria so people wouldn't see me eating alone. I skipped lunch and just sat in the counselors office. Starting medication as my senior year helped only a little. 

I'm permentatly mentally fucked up for the rest of my life. 

I suffer from existentialism and DPDR. Nothing feels real anymore. I can see, but at the same time I can't. The world feels fake, like the Truman show. It's horrifying. 

Then this person who I thought was my friend harassed me about my sexuality. They used to make comments towards me that made me uncomfortable. They never respected my boundaries when I told them there were things I didn't want to talk about due to my abuse. They didn't care. I still stayed friends with them because I was desperate for human connection.

It came to a point where they would make uncomfortable comments towards me and belittled me and degraded me so much that I just yelled at them. They blocked me because I was yelling at them and I just spiraled. I was yelling because I was upset that they were never listening to me. I'm so embarrassed. Why did I spam them for weeks, I should've just let it go. Why did I keep apologizing. Why did I say I send a gun picture saying I'd kill myself to them after they blocked me? And before you say I was threatening suicide (maybe I was, I was so out of it I don't even know what my intentions were) , I already talked to them about being suicidal and talked about that I wantrd to die even when we talked. I guess in my mind at the time when I was losing my shit and sent that I thought because they gave me permission to say those things when we were still talking that I justified it in my head that they didn't care if I said it. I don't like that but I know I did wrong. I feel guilty and horrible for it. 

I warned them that I would lose it if they wouldn't respect the things I didn't want to talk about but I fucking hate myself for being so god damned stupid. I don't interact with people much so I didn't realize how far I'd gone.  

And now this person keeps trying to get people online to block me. It won't stop happening and it's been two years. They don't tell people that they harassed me first either. Recently this person who was supposed to commission me blocked me because I blocked them temporarily for space. The person told them about me, and now they constantly seek my accounts to find me. I've been feeling so depressed because of it. I'm now haunted even more for acting stupid when I was an out of isolation 18 year old.

I can't even be happy I got my job. I can't stop thinking about people hating me. People stalking my accounts. My parents yelling at me and calling me names. Recently my mom kicked me outside in the snow in my pajamas because I started screaming after she was bullying me.

I'm so fucked. My brain is so far gone. I'm basically a corpse at this point. I'm on autopilot. No longer can feel happy. I don't have a sense of identity. I hate myself so much I can't even look in the mirror. I've gained weight and become fat. 

It's over. I'll never be able to recover. I make such stupid mistakes. I start to feel like my family was right to abuse me and hit me.

I'll never be able to get into a good college. I'll never achieve my dreams of becoming an artist. I'll never get married. I'll never.

I wish I could kill myself but I can't. My life is pointless. At this point, I am a walking zombie devoid of emotion who sticks to a routine to live the rest of my life.

1jr1lyv,depression,1743734877.0,"I'm envious of people saying their medication make them zombies I would love nothing more than to slow down my mind and stop thinking so much. To just go on autopilot and just get through the days. I don't want clarity of the same life that already makes me feel bad as is.

Never have I felt more envious of a movie than ""Click"". And how flat the whole moral about the ""autopilot"" landed on someone like me. I get the message, but the message isn't for me. I would love nothing more than an autopilot button that turned off my thinking and just had me do.

These daily experiences are not worth having. They are the same every single time. Everything interesting and unique about them is long gone. It's just going through the motions now. The same ones over and over.

I really don't care to change. I'm exhausted of the attempts. I just accept this is what my life is and I just want to chug through it until it's okay for it to be over. Which only terrifies and brings about panic attacks from me. But the suffering of thinking isn't much better.

Life is long and agonizing. Maybe one day in the future it will change. I could bring it about myself, but I just don't want to anymore. I'm too tired.

I've been on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. It's really hard to tell anything is different. I seem to have the same happy mood swings for a moment that I always had, but then rapidly back down to just nothing again. I seem to have the same bouts of extreme sadness and ideation. The Wellbutrin may have given me a little energy, but energy for what?

Nothing is bad about my life. I just can't feel good about it. I don't get whatever fabled happy feelings from exercise. It's just the relief of being over and then nothing a minute later. I've ran 10ks and felt nothing. I don't understand the experiences and descriptions people have. I have to always actively think to be happy about things, it never comes naturally. Fleeting joy and laughter sure, but happiness, I don't feel. I don't get it. I don't understand.

I just want to exist until I don't have to anymore and it's just done. I wish I was mentally and completely handicapped. I can't handle this, I'm not that strong. I don't want to die, but I don't want to think. 

I'm so tired.

I sit writing this now 45+ minutes in my car in front of my parents house I'm supposed to have dinner at. A mostly weekly event. I can't convince myself to go in. I have no good reason not to.

1jr0083,depression,1743729922.0,"kinda feeling lost so the title says everything nonetheless but I guess I’ll go into detail what that entails. I’m in college and my life literally only consists of work and school. I stay in my apartment most of the time and hardly go out unless for work and when I am forced to go to lectures or discussions (marked attendance). I feel pretty sad most of the time, not motivated but I’ll get my work done just takes me longer than it probably should take a normal person. the only person I actually enjoy to put effort in talking to is my boyfriend and we’ve been together for the past 3 years. I feel like I sabotage our relationship with my emotions and how much value I put into him in making him like the center of my world. mind you we’re long distance as well so I only see him on the weekends but I don’t find any enjoyment or pleasure in speaking to anyone at work or in class and I mean I don’t feel bad about it either.

1jqzp1s,depression,1743728962.0,"Warning: CP, manipulation, death So I'm having some trouble with smoking, I'm doing it more and more, right, and my lungs have been shitty since I was a kid. I went from one cigarette a month to half a pack every day in the span of a few months and I really don't want this to stay a habit. Part of it is stress smoking because of depression. I'm beginning with this smaller thing to ease y'all into it.

I started smoking because I wanted to be more like my old crush, N, who I was like best friends with for a couple years and I never really got iver them. They were pretty manipulative about it when they found out, like a lot of lying and gaslighting etc. We were no longer close friends at this point, and N had instead begun hanging out with this bitch I'll call C. C is a convicted rapist and pedophile.

I don't know why C was more worth hanging around than me, and it's always bugged me that THIS GUY was my replacement. I always knew there were rumors he was a rapist and supposedly convicted. I believed it, and I guess I was right to do so. Now, he's been found with 80 pictures of cp, mostly pre pubertal kids and some of them in diapers. Can it get more fucked up? Yes it can.

In the police reports, paid for by a friend of a friend who then spread the pictures of them, everything is in extreme detail. C basically confessed to all of it with a very weak excuse for it, saying he just looked it up for shock value and stuff, and often met with somebody else on the weekends where they swapped shocking pics, for some reason. I know C and N go to different schools but are still close and have said they're like ""twins"". Yay. Knowing some shit I know about N, like that they've said they sometimes look up very very bad stuff as a form of mental self harm, I'm just afraid the second person mentioned in the police reports is them. I lost a lot of respect when I learned their best friend was a rapist, after all, but if I had any left, now it's gone.

Surely it doesn't get weirder? No, then I bring it up to my mom, and she goes on about how badly sex offenders of this sort get treated in prison, we all know that. Then she brings up vigilante justice, you know, random people taking the law into their own hands, and claims that's common in our country. I disagree with her, as it's not exactly something you hear about often. She counters it by saying she has a friend who has killed a pedophile and that it got covered up by the police. Okayyyy. Apparently this person is someone I've met, too, never knowing he's a killer.

Like, vigilante justice makes sense to me, okay, not the Batman kind, but like, overall, for extreme crimes. But I feel sick both because of what C did, what N may have had to do with it, and the fact my mom just shrugged over what she told me like it was normal. I can't say that was wrong to do, but it is still so fucked up. No mercy for fucking pedophiles, right? I still kind of hate that it happened. Which is weird.

I didn't think the day could get worse, but as I'm smoking to try to think things through, I leave a door open out to our yard and our many cats almost run away, thankfully they didn't make it outside (they're indoor cats) but it scared the life out of me. And then I find out my therapist (not exactly therapist but basically) isn't available and probably quit her job and I don't feel like explaining my whole situation all over again to someone new who won't fucking understand. Then N texts me after months of no contact, only repeating an inside joke we had but I know it's to check whether I've heard the news. And here I am hoping for a response because I'm still in love with this idiot who threw me away like nothing once I admittedly got pretty clingy and replaced me with a sexual predator who likes to look at little kids in ducking DIAPERS. So yeah I'm not doing so good in quitting smoking. I don't know how I haven't had a full meltdown or cut myself yet but I guess it's coming.

Bonus info: N has a variety of self harm methods, not sure if they're still doing it, they've claimed to have stopped which I hope is true. Including: watching CP to make themselves nauseous, showering in too cold or too hot water, once until passing out, cutting themselves, and talking sexually to adults online (back when they were still 17). I was always worried sick.

A few months back neither of us were doing well mentally, but we helped each other.

Since then we've been distant and I've still been struggling, I reached out and she said she's doing great mentally, which is amazing, but I'm worried that she's been doing so well when I haven't been a part of her life since.

1jqxzcn,depression,1743723967.0,"I am completely lost in my own head 
I (18 m) am in my last year of high school, but I have never felt more lonely. Every close friend group I have had has either drifted apart in high school or, with my most recent one, completely pushed me out. 

I’ve been dealing with pretty bad social anxiety and depression since middle school where my friends at the time would relentlessly bully me for being overweight. I would always laugh it off and try to say something back, but it hurt. I started going to the gym mid way through freshman year and now look a little better, but people still make relentless comments about it and I’m just supposed to take it. I think I’m decently strong but all I ever get called is fat and ugly. I look at myself in the mirror and see progress I am proud of, but it always morphs into disgust and hate for what I look like. I go to the gym don’t have the self control to stop myself from eating. 

In school I’m always scared about what people are thinking about me. If they think I’m ugly or fat or weird. I’d like to think I look okay but I’m always so self conscious about it. I see all my friends prospering and receiving positive attention, but all I feel like is the butt of every joke. I’m no longer proud of the things I used to be because my peers are better than me at what feels like almost every task. 

It doesn’t matter that I’m in AP classes when I can barely pass while everyone around me seems to be flying through it. I got pushed out of my friend group because someone who I thought I was good friends with suddenly stopped inviting me out to things with them. It was a party here or there and then it turned into no longer being in holiday events when our entire friend group and even people not close to our friend group were getting invited. No group chats with me in them, no nothing. I asked a couple of my friends from the group what I did and they said nothing, that the guy just doesn’t like me. 

So for most of my senior year I have been at home. Barely going out with one or two friends a couple times a month and spending every break and holiday home alone. There was a whole situation with my girl hooking up with another guy as well, but there is already a post up about that. I just can’t bring myself to hate or dislike these people who seem to dislike me though. I don’t know why but I just can’t. I still want to be their friend, but another part of me knows that I would be doing myself a disservice. This just isn’t how I wanted my senior year to go, isolated from my peers, stuck sitting alone after I bought prom tickets and my friends didn’t tell me they filled up the table, spending all my time at home, and being looked at as a loser by my peers. 

It’s so confusing in my head though. Some days I feel full of myself, like I’m better than others, that I’m stronger or smarter, and then I feel inferior to everyone, like a loser. I hate seeing friends and family in need or isolated, but unless it’s them being left out, I can’t seem to bring myself to care about their problems or how they feel. I know it’s wrong and I want people to be happy but I just don’t feel connected enough to actually obtain a true grasp of how they feel, more like a fleeting moment of it that is quickly replaced by annoyance or apathy. I hate that I’m like this.

I hate being alone, I hate being weird, I hate being fat, I hate being the punching bag for everyone else to make fun of and ignore. I’m not as openly made fun of as some other kids as I try to act as normal and chilled out as possible, taking every insult in the chin and trying to act like just a normal guy, but I still know people do. It hurts not knowing what I did to make people dislike me, to want to apologize but unable to because I don’t know what I’ve done wrong. I feel like a failure, like a background character in my own life. I apologize for everything because I feel bad, not because of how the other person thinks about things, but because I fail to meet the image of the person I want to be. It doesn’t matter that I’ve lost weight, put on muscle, become more normal, become less emotional, or stopped taking things to heart. In my head I still just feel weak.

I want to love people and be loved but I can’t do either. Everyone around me seems so motivated but I’m just not. I feel lonely and angry and I don’t know where I’ve gone wrong. I’m an average teenager but I feel like such an outlier. I like MMA, weight lifting, gaming, anime, sports, and cars, yet I still feel like I have nothing to connect with people over. I always feel like the person I’m talking to isn’t a peer, but is always someone so much better than me or someone I look down on with disdain because they act like the me that got made fun of more and couldn’t keep that veil of indifference on. I think those kids are cringey and weird but I used to be like them, and a part of me is still like that, though I can’t show anybody. I still try to be nice to them, but not because I care about how they feel. I would just feel bad being mean if that makes sense. 
 
Sorry this post is so unorganized, but I have a lot going through my head and I’m barely keeping together the image of a chilled out guy who doesn’t care what people think while I’m secretly hoping they don’t think negative about me. I know I’m a giant hypocrite and I feel bad about it but I’m just stuck in a cycle of what feels like narcissism and self loathing. (Another weird point but I hate when people self diagnose and claim these things about themselves to be quirky, yet I do the same thing.) I view myself as better than others in so many ways yet feel like I’m something worthless in comparison most of the time. I just feel unimportant. I don’t feel happy around other people but feel lonely and sad in their absence. I don’t feel the type of love I used to towards my family and it scares me that I feel less and less connected to them, to the point they feel further away from me than most of my friends. I’m trapped wanting to not be alone but not feeling anything when I have people with me and I hate it.

Even now I’m trying my best not to sound cringey on this post and it’s just coming out as a mess. Again, sorry for the poor structure, I normally am decent at writing, but I’m just having a hard time painting what my life is like without trying to sound super self pitying or like I’m trying to be quirky.

But once you have discarded possible physical reasons (blood test, maybe neurology), you can be as terribly sad as you may be but there is only one way of getting out of it: keep living. Yes, there are meds and stuff, but absolutely all of them treat the symptom. They are notngoing to get you cured, they will just make you feel better for a while.

After that is a matter of trying new things to deal with the emotion until you, one day, are able to understand what the fuck is happening to you.

He was the first man I loved. I think I will only love him.

I miss him so much...everything reminds me of him.  I can't move forward, I don't think I want to.

He was so important. I was finally me. I was finally able to express my love to him after all this time. Whole hours on the phone. Our looks spoke for us. These songs to indirectly tell each other that we love each other. It was stronger than me. Much too strong not to imply something to him. I thought I was dreaming the night we kissed. This love made me discover a sensation that I did not know. I would have done anything for him. I had seduced a heterosexual.

When I looked at him, it was obvious. I wanted it for my whole life. I had never felt like that.

But I'm not a girl...

I want to cry in his arms, tell him I'm sorry. Sorry for not being up to the task.

Sorry for being me...

I will never forget that day he left me. That day when he turned his back on me forever. That day when he said those hurtful words. That day when we were torn apart. I don't want to believe it happened.

Hard not to see a message from him - Hard to no longer hear the sound of his voice - Hard to no longer laugh at our stupidities - Hard to no longer feel his hand - Hard to no longer wake up with him - Hard to have 
his sweater - Hard to have to forget it.

1jqts5i,depression,1743713252.0,"At what point does depression turn into self-harm and suicidal ideation, how bad does my mental state have to get? I was diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety recently, as someone in their early adolescence, actively having 2 therapy sessions weekly, prescribed Fluoxetine. 

In comparison to the majority of people on this platform, my condition is most likely not even worth mentioning, quite frankly, since it isn't that bad, but I still wanted to get an outside perspective.

Generally speaking, I am not concerned about attempting self-harm or committing suicide currently. At least, not yet. My mental health is deteriorating, so it might worry me in the foreseeable future, but I have so far never gotten any thoughts of harming myself or ending it all. 
 Please offer me advice or opinions on what to do moving forward.

Here are my symptoms:

Excessive guilt, Reminiscing the past, Lack of motivation, Overthinking, Binge eating, Always tired, Intrusive thoughts, Low self-esteem, Highly sensitive to criticism or anything deemed less than perfect, and Easily tearful.

Hormones and stress are also causes for some of these, not just depression, but I believe there is at least a somewhat correlation between these signs and my worsened depression.

At the end of the day, I am just a kid trying to fix my issue before adulthood arrives, so any assistance or support y'all can offer is much appreciated by me.

I developed a illness that significantly impacted my weight and eating habits and for months I’ve been in a lot of pain. At the worst of it, I was extremely depressed and suicidal. I even set a date and made a plan to do it. But on the day of, I went out and really thought about everything. There was a lot I  still wanted to do so although I was so mentally and physically exhausted I just couldn’t go through with it. 

I ended up telling my mom about how I had been feeling. I haven’t opened up to her since I was a kid. And the second I told her I realised why I stopped opening up to her. She got really disappointed at me when I told her I was feeling suicidal. Which kind of made me feel even worst than I already did.

So, I just started trying things on my own. I tried doing the things I love before. My illness has become more manageable with medication, so I tried doing things like watching the shows i used to love and trying to go outside, which is hard because its winter where I am. I tried applying for jobs again and I even reached out to my friend who I was very distant with because of the illness and the depression making me isolate myself. I tried talking to my family more too, I didn't open up to them again, but I tried talking casually about stuff. And for a while things where going well. 

But then the pain came back in different ways and I feel like my illness is changing or getting worst. My friend hasn't answered me in 2 weeks even though they have read my messages. And my family keep acting like I'm fine. They keep  forgetting that I'm sick and telling me to eat things and do stuff that they know I can't in my condition. And on top of all it, I just feel so fucking lonely. I know it's my own fault for isolating myself but I wish someone cared enough to not let me deal with this alone.

My thoughts have been spiraling and I'm started to get back to that low point I was at before. I keep thinking back and regretting not going forward with that suicide attempt. And it makes me feel so guilt because I wanted to try and get better.

I’ve been abused twice-once by a neighbour when I was a kid and again by someone I was seeing when I was around 20 yo.

I’ve suffered with my self-esteem,not physically but of who I am inside as a person,never thought someone could really like me. Overcame that and things became easier. But my depression always come back and the feeling of ending it becomes more often.

i went through a lot. recently ive been having issues. 

I learned how to code at age 12 (and didn't stop). I've had lots of breakthroughs in other areas of my life. I was that nerdy kid that really never spoke to others because of strong fear and constantly comparing myself to others. 

Something I've learned about myself is that I'm incapable of having friends because of my trauma. I just think they're a waste of time entirely and they're only going to hurt me. I just feel a strong emotional hatred for people around me at all times. Like every little flaw ruins their entire character, and they'll never care about me. They don't care about themselves. ""They're just stupid."" I know its bad but I don't know how to fix it. 

I did have tons of online friends for awhile but I snapped and isolated myself one day in 2022 and I haven't been the same since. 

The problem is that I've had massive anhedonia for life in general. 6 months ago I was able to play things like video games/tv shows, now I feel as if my time is entirely wasted even being on them for 20 minutes. Like the only thing that matters in my life is how much I can overwork myself. 

This has lead to a conflicted state. When I work I feel like I'm stabbing myself repeatedly and enjoying it at the same time. It feels great in the moment, but the second you let go, you immediately start feeling terrible. It's sort of like being in love with something that is incapable of loving you back.

I'll usually end up in a psychotic state after working 7 days a week because I just get so fixated on what I enjoy doing. If I could live in an office with a bedroom I probably would. I think my past is hurting me more then I'd like, but I'd rather forget about my past.

My suicidal thoughts (and my thought disorder) have gotten a lot worse. I've always felt a very weak connection to life because of T1D. The thing is, I want to be deeply connected to this world. I just don't know how people are able to enjoy simpler things. The complex things I love a lot make thought disorder worse, while the easy to understand things become very boring and monotonous.

I feel like the emotional side of me has died. I'm not a psychopath because I still care, but the emotions I do have are entirely muted. I will feel them intensely but be unable to act on them. I'll feel angry but I won't even raise my voice. I'll just look at you and speak normally as if I'm hiding it. Like they still exist but I pretend they aren't there.

anyway, here goes: i have a very small fan account on twitter and i have this nice mutual on there. we're not friends and have barely interacted but i have wanted to be friends with her for a while. but she's depressed and i think even has some suicidal thoughts. when she posts those thoughts, some of her friends and even i try to leave positive/encouraging messages but well.. you guys probably already know that that's not all that helpful. even just a few hours ago, she posted something that read like suicidal ideation. i didn't really know what to say tbh. even generally i am not great at making conversation, but with heavy topics especially i often end up saying the wrong thing.   
  
so what i want to know is - should i try to reach out to her or leave her be? would she feel burdened if i dm'ed her out of nowhere? if i do message her, should i try to talk about our mutual interest or send her words of encouragement or something to that effect?  
  
disclaimer: please keep in mind that i'm only doing this for selfish reasons.. i just know we'd get along and i don't really have many friends i can talk to. i have no misconceptions that i can 'fix' her or even help her in any way because i have been depressed in the past as well. in fact i'm probably still a bit depressed but it's not that bad now.

1jqgmxh,depression,1743681887.0,"Feeling like im slipping back into a depression. Hello and sorry first, English is my second language.

Three years ago, I got diagnosed with depressive phases and a panic disorder. I got antidepressants and after a while i got better. I never saw a psychologist or a therapist and since the last two weeks i feel like im slipping back into the depression.

I think my work contributes the most to how I feel. For about two months I feel chronically stressed, I only sleep with medication, I have no interest in social activities and most of the time I feel a heavy void inside me. 

It depresses me a lot that I can't give up my work. I need the money for my apartment and for bills. A new education would ruin me sooner or later. 

I feel like I'm never going to escape my work; I'm afraid of my future, I make good money and I hate myself more every day. 

I don't know what I'm expecting. maybe I just had to get rid of this. maybe there's someone here who feels the same.

1jqg6n4,depression,1743680527.0,"Did I irreversibly fuck up? Hello! My husband and I have been together for about 10 years. He’s been depressed on and off throughout the time, but recently it’s hit a point where I’ve never seen him at. On Monday he was so close to attempting to end it all. In the end he decided against it and we didn’t really talk about it further. We see the same therapist, so I told him he will be coming with me to my session on Wednesday. I had texted the therapist before giving her a heads up about what happened. We came up with a plan for how to discuss it in therapy. On the ride over my husband was begging me not to tell her, saying it will ruin everything and our relationship will never be the same. The thing is, he doesn’t know that I already told her. And that I need to speak about it with someone. It’s not fair to me to make me hold in all of that to myself. I thought therapy went fine— we made a safety plan and talked about IOPs (just as a step— not necessarily to go) and the therapist swore she would not be calling EMS today. He was quiet in the session but I thought he was fine. 

Turns out I was dead wrong. The second we got into the car to go home he kept yelling at me saying how badly I betrayed him. How I ruined his life. How I just couldn’t keep my mouth shut. He was saying some really cruel things. I kept apologizing and explaining my point of view. He says I have ruined the relationship. He says he still loves me but he’s disgusted by how I couldn’t keep my mouth shut and do the one thing he asked me to do— not tell the therapist. He said we could have worked it out just the two of us and I have ruined the relationship. 

We slept in different rooms last night and he’s not speaking to me this morning. Was I wrong to tell our therapist? Going in I thought I’d rather him be mad at me than not, but I was trying to help him. He’s convinced his life is ruined now 
because his safety plan is on file. I’ve explained to him the only time EMS would be called after the safety plan is if he tries again, tells someone he tried, and then tells them he didn’t follow the safety plan. 

I love this man so much and I’ve been doing so much for the decade we’ve been together. Was it wrong for me to tell the therapist? I hope he will understand I did it out of love and care for him. I feel so lost and I am afraid I ruined my marriage by telling the therapist. 

EDIT: in the past he’s spoken to me constantly about how he wants to end it all and how he wants to die. We normally have a conversation between us about this. On Monday it was to a level I’ve never seen before. He had a plan and ideation. And for the therapist, we see the same therapist both individually and as a couple.

I should be happy, I am grateful and I've worked damned hard to be where I am.  But it's meaningless.  I'm 50 this year and have struggled with ""depression"" nearly all my life.  As a young boy I always dreamed about dying and that has never gone away, just more graphic.  There is always a sense of ending it, even when there shouldn't be.  I've tried multiple times (since my teens) and the shame that follows.  I don't think I'd try again as I know what I'd have to do to not fail.  I know if I did I wouldn't care as I'd not exist, but the mess I'd put the people I do care about through is what holds me back.  I worry that this won't always work and obviously hasn't in the past.    
I was on meds for a long time and have stopped taking them several times, I hate them.  I'm currently off them (again) and have no desire to go back on them.  I've tried alcohol to ""cope"", but that just makes things 100% worse, I've tried drugs, but that shit catches up with you and will rob you of everything.  I only stopped the drugs 4 months ago in the hope of making changes to ""fix"" whatever is broken.  But there is no fix.  Therapy can eat a dick.  I hate complaining and the thought of bitching about how shit I feel to someone is unpalatable.  yeah yeah and yet here I am online!  I do breakdown on a friend every few years when I've run out of steam and feel I've lost the plot.  It's unfair on them and what can they do apart from what me self destruct?!  
I kid myself everyday, I'm doing the right thing, working hard, paying my bills and being kind, though that has landed me in bad situations where it became a detriment and a drain because a gave more than I had to offer.  But this shit just goes round and round and I just want it to stop.  I see shit online about how we're in a simulation which makes me smile.. it's funny.  But some part of me wishes it was true, but then if it was, what then?  I can't run away from me, I can't end it, I can't go on about it.  Ultimately I'm alone, I can't rely on others to make me happy or make sense of things.  Everything comes to the same place, this place where I am now.  Nothing.

1jqf4yr,depression,1743677064.0,"I stopped having depressions overnight. It wasn’t magic. It was structure. This will sound unbelievable, so I’ll keep it simple and honest.

I used to be depressed. For years. Same thoughts, same feelings, same weight. I’d reflect, analyze, try to find the “root cause.” I was smart, introspective, serious about understanding myself. But no matter how deeply I thought, I kept ending up in the same place.

One day, I realized something:

>I’m not merely thinking the same thought over and over. I’m following a chain of thoughts—and that chain always leads me back to the beginning.

That was the moment it hit me.  
I was thinking in a **loop**.

Each thought in the loop made sense. It logically followed from the previous one. And because it felt like progress, I never realized I was *orbiting*. I thought I was “processing” or “unpacking” something important. That I was about to uncover the root cause and stop having depressions altogether.

But I wasn’t solving anything. I was just repeating a structure.

Once I recognized that I was thinking in a loop, I had to ask:

>If I’ve gone through this loop hundreds—maybe thousands—of times, and never found relief… …then maybe the answer I’m looking for isn’t in the loop.

That insight didn’t “fix” me. It didn't make me tolerate the fact that I'm depressed. To live my life despite of depression. No, it just **ended the loop**.

I stopped engaging with it.  
And the depression stopped, too. **Overnight**.

Not because I changed my thoughts.  
Not because I fought them.  
But because I recognized that I could be searching in a limited―and wrong―set of thoughts.

Essentially, I recognized that I might be wasting my time with a circular chain of thoughts that didn't even contain the resolution.

A few things I learned:

* Thoughts aren’t random. They’re *led*. One implies the next.
* If that chain loops back, you’ll think you’re exploring—but you’re just orbiting.
* Depression (at least mine) wasn’t a feeling—it was the shape of a *system of thought*.
* Trying to replace “bad thoughts” just rearranges the loop.
* And believing I had “free will” in what I was thinking made it harder to see that I was being *carried* by the structure itself.

Once I saw it as structure, not identity, I stepped out of it.  
Effortlessly. And effortlessly in the strongest sense of the word: **It took no effort**.  
And I haven’t had a depression since. That was over 20 years ago.

I’m not claiming this applies to everyone.  
I’m just saying: for me, depression wasn’t something broken.  
It was introspective capacity misconfigured into a looping chain of thought.

And once I recognized that, it ended, and I could see what everyone else had told me ad nauseam: That my issue was a non-issue. I couldn't see it from within, but it became obvious when I left the loop.

If this clicks with even one person, I’ll write more.  
No theories, no positivity, no affirmations. Just honest structure from someone who got free.

1jqeb0i,depression,1743673965.0,"My partner feels lost and seems very disconnected.. how do I help? Please be kind, I don’t normally make these kinds of posts. I felt this might be the place to get some insight. My boyfriend has always had times where he gets into “moods”, as he calls it. He says it hard to explain but it’s always lingering and sometimes it comes stronger than other days. In my opinion, it has never been this bad before. 

He has slowly over the course of the last year or so started to seem more distant, way more wrapped up in work, and altogether less present. I knew things were happening to the relationship that concerned me. I would bring it up but try to give him grace when it’s not fixed right away or when he seemed distant because he has a very demanding job and our schedules can be polar opposites for months at a time. 

I’m coming to accept that this is just where we’re at now. I tried to put into my mind when I noticed little things here and there that it was because of his job or because he’s tired this week. But it has remained constant.

Here’s what I’ve noticed: He doesn’t try like he used to when it comes to fixing or putting work into the relationship. He has made some decisions that were quite odd to me since we’ve been together for 5 years. We used to be attached at the hip and now it’s like he makes little effort: not reaching out at all when I was on my trip or him volunteering to work his days off when we hadn’t seen much of each other. He used to say, “okay, you’re feeling this way, what can I do? How can I help you”. He doesn’t anymore. He shuts down when we have an uncomfortable or stressful topic of conversation come up and basically stonewalls me (which has been a thing in our relationship at times but way more frequently now..I try to be patient. I ask if we need to pause to give him time to process things and decompress). This happens even if he initiated the conversation. But then I need to be the one to bring it up again if we had paused or if we stopped speaking because he stops responding to me because “I don’t know what to say”. If I was the one upset at something he did, I have to be the one to reach out to make things better between us. 

If I tell him exactly how I am feeling and what I would desire from him, he does not do it. Example being: I told him I’d love to have a date night before I leave for my trip. We hadn’t had much quality time lately and had been a bit out of touch with each other. I thought it’d be nice to get out of the house together. He agreed. But then later he tells me that he scheduled himself to pull overtime.. knowing that we made a plan. Or: “what I need from you is to give a little reassurance when I bring this up, maybe give me a hug or hold my hand and tell me you hear me.”Doesn’t do that, just: “okay. Sorry”. And disassociates the rest of the evening. Doesn’t say goodnight or I love you when going to bed.

When I asked him why he does those things he said he’s not sure. He shared that he’s been feeling very lost and like all he does is hurt me. He feels like he doesn’t know what he’s doing and just making decisions on autopilot. 

It’s been slowly progressing to this point for a long while and it hurts me to know that our relationship has changed so much to where this is how we are now. I am only human.. I struggle between feeling neglected and abandoned in the relationship and trying to be there to the best of my ability and remember that he’s going through something I will never be able to fully understand the way he does.

All in all, even if we don’t last romantically, even if we can’t go back to what we used to have I would still like to help him in any way that I can. He is truly a wonderful person and has also helped me over the years through some of my personal struggles.

1jqdoqn,depression,1743671480.0,"I am a Failure, by every definition of it. For the last three years, I’ve been stuck in a cycle of procrastination, avoidance, and self-doubt. I kept telling myself I would change, that I would get serious, that I had time. But I didn’t. Time ran out. I failed a major exam—one I can’t retake. No second chances, no redemption, just failure staring me in the face.

Right now, I feel like I’ve thrown away years of my life. I had ambitions, big ones. I wanted to be disciplined, to push myself, to win. But instead, I let fear control me. I avoided the hard work. I wasted days, weeks, months, thinking “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Now there’s no tomorrow for this exam. Just the realization that I didn’t fight hard enough.

The worst part? I didn’t even give it my all. I didn’t fail because I tried my hardest and fell short—I failed because I was a coward. I let laziness, fear, and distraction dictate my actions. I ignored reality until it was too late. And now, I’m left with regret.

And honestly? It’s eating me alive. I’ve had suicidal thoughts because of this. I feel like I don’t deserve to keep going after wasting so much time. But at the same time, there’s still a small part of me that wants to fight, that wants to fix this and never let it happen again.

For those of you who’ve been in a place like this—where you’ve wasted years and had to rebuild from rock bottom—how did you do it? How do you go from being a lazy, inconsistent mess to someone who actually executes every single day? How do I make sure I never, ever end up here again?

1jqcfjw,depression,1743666388.0,"Life doesn’t feel worth living anymore Disclaimer: Long message ahead. 

I’ve not been doing emotionally well since the last couple of years. There were some hardships at home when I started dating a guy. After few months of dating, he turned into a physically abusive partner. I didn’t know how to deal with it or seek help. The first time I was scared and didn’t know what to do, but second time.. it became something I need to tackle (he ofc overpowered me), by third, it became something I’m used to.. and eventually you start believing maybe I deserved it. (Though I know I didn’t but because I ended up just trying to live with it). Finally, we broke up and I was emotionally trying to deal with the trauma and was very happy that relationship ended. 

I was in a new place that time so I was only starting to have a life there. 4 months post this I met someone in the office and we had an instant connection. I wasn’t ready to date anyone at that point and made it clear. He became my best friend and we eventually did end up dating. 6 months in and he wanted to marry me. I wasn’t ready, I was traumatised from my past, pressurised myself about the future to be perfect and .. then things started spiralling down. I knew the guy I was dating was actually pretty immature and irresponsible. Bur for me he started to change and became responsible. The only thing, he bought in marriage too quickly in us and wasn’t able to understand how much I was dealing with that time. I had some personal issues as well and the past abusive relationship was only a part. One day, during one of our fights, (I’m assuming he was also on an acid downer that day), we had a fight and that day things turned physically abusive with him. This time, I wasn’t going to take it. He knew about my past.. and I just feel instead of understanding me, he used it against me. I couldn’t call the cops, but I called up his parents (idk why but I still didn’t have the guts to call up the cops). That was the first time. He apologised like crazy and I know that he is not that kind of a guy so I forgave it. It happened again, but before that a bunch of things happened that triggered my trauma. I don’t have any memories from the past, but my trauma gets triggered. 
Eventually, I started loving him truly which I wasn’t able to do before because of my past trauma and anxiety. But by that time.. he had also been through a lot with me. He doesn’t communicate very well. And when he did, I was overwhelmed. And finally when we reached a point when we could, he had his defenses too high to see anything. He has never asked me about my trauma or understood how my responses were affected but instead blamed me for it. I didn’t receive the support I needed when I was trying MY LEVEL FUCKING BEST to do the right things to recover. Eventually he started saying things like I deserved it. He is an egoistic person and when people found out about few of the bad instances, he started lying to them. He wants me to accept things I didn’t do to satisfy the “public needs” that his people pleasing personality demands. I can’t. I won’t. When i haven’t done him this wrong, I won’t. 
We went on a break and got back together a year ago.. and I told him that this time I’ll fully invest and I’m aware of the issues I have and he wanted us to go for counselling. But that’s when I saw his behaviour being different. It was coming from an aggressive and power playing mind set. Now his intentions had changed though he may not have said it. But his actions proved it. I believed him to not be a shallow person, but.. he did things otherwise. I kept forgiving him.. because he asked for unconditional love which eventually became one sided. He kept thinking of how he was in pain a lot and instead of communicating about it, I’m blamed for it. Instead of talking which I had begged him for, he acknowledges sometimes that he didn’t handle some things maturely and just doesn’t show care. 
Cut to today, he said he doesn’t want anything to do with me. He took the last few months to made me miserable while I let him be my life. I was anyways not doing well emotionally and life with him felt like it had a purpose. Now it doesn’t. 

This makes me not want to live anymore. I’ve thought a lot about it. I know im a head strong person and can get through this phase.. but I’ve stopped seeing a point of any of it.  I don’t think I can do justice to myself or anyone else in my life after losing so much respect and happiness. I don’t have it in me to feel content anymore. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me feel content. 

I know it’s stupid but I try to tell myself that it’s not the worst, and there are people out there who have gone through worse. I know that if I want to live and get through this, I can. The only thing is.. I won’t be happy. I haven’t been happy in the last 6 years. And he was the only one that had given me any hope before absolutely destroying it. 

I have a supportive family and a supportive friend’s group as well. But internally, I am done. I’ve been in this cycle enough to emotionally exhaust me to a point I don’t find happiness in anything. I know there are a lot of things to do, explore. But nothing makes me want to exist.

1jqc3gd,depression,1743665006.0,"I'm lost Given my age, my life, not having many, other than my parents, and wanting them and my other close ones to be a part of my special day, I decided to go ahead with my marriage. 

Now I'm fighting my own battle, internally. My parent doesn't want to part with me nor do I but someday when I'm left alone in life, I need someone to call mine, I only have my partner and the way my parent is almost complaining like saying they're going to get me married off, let me take care of my life, they'll go away somewhere (because my partner is abroad, they can't relocate), I found the partner, let me settle things with my life etc etc. Making me want to give up on everything as if I'm commiting a crime.

I feel so frustrated with my life. All others are getting married with so much joy and excitement but here I am, struggling to even think about it without feeling bad or guilty.

What do I do with this life? My partner is unwell but I can't go due to my overprotective parent. It's been this way for the entirety of my relationship. Why everyone reacts like ""oh so you're going to leave your parent and go be with your partner?"". I value them. My sibling got away with everything and I'm the one getting treated this way even after being the obedient and caring child.

Sometimes I feel like leaving everyone and going somewhere else because I'm tired of being the centre of both their wants and needs.

On the other hand, I'm struggling to find a job and everyone keeps asking have you found one already? I hate it. I'm trying and why question me like I'm compelled to do something like that. I know what I want in life but I'm not getting it. I'm tired of trying.

I feel so bad when I see people having a career, working, earning. I feel like a loser.

Sometimes I feel like snapping at my parent that I'll cancel the wedding and go away.

No degree even though I have other qualifications. Earned a degree. Age caught up. Vacancies for ages ... -... Why not see my skills? I'm not old. Why restrict like that? I'm tired of searching for jobs.

1jqakeu,depression,1743659070.0,"depressed genius, it is quite lonely today (155+ iq and 140+ eq in some test I was almost forced to take a while back.)

I've written many research papers but never published and maybe they will once I leave existence for the next set of alive beings.

My kid died 1 year ago, my wife was 15 years ago, she took her own life and my kid suffered from a rare disease. The kid hurt me way more, because I was on a business trip and didn't think I wouldn't be back in time to take him home from the hospital - I ended up getting there too late even for the funeral.

I have a good salary, my job is very demanding, I'm mostly alone, most of the time.

I've got millions (usd) in the bank account, could travel anywhere in the world, eat whatever I want, do whatever I want, but the sadness creeps in sometimes.

I've written many research papers but never tried to publish any of them. I've never shared them with anyone and I honestly don't care about sharing my research, it is done for myself and not for other. I'm not sure many, or maybe anyone, would understand. It's not driven by ego, its driven by curiosity.

I've tackled every single problem I could find in the last 50 years and I've come with terms with every single one of them, with a solution I am happy with. Some I didn't solve and some I did. I always find it fascinating when someone else solves a problem that hasn't been solved before while I had but never published. I always read and sort of connect with how they solved it, the similarities and the differences are always fascinating.

I could retire if I want to, but I don't want to give up on humanity or on my existence in this universe. The quiet live just isn't for me, never has, and never will be.

I like to tell myself that I'm fine, but sometimes the sadness creeps in. It sucks that I've only met maybe 5-10 people in my life with the same mental capacity as me, and every single one of them are like me, in a sense it feels like we never grew up, that we are still a kid inside, curious about everything but with these fascination for complexity and turning impossible problems in a possibility. but, we are all loners. months go by without seeing anyone, just working in solitude and not speaking to anyone outside of work hours - there are multiple days where I don't say a single word all day.  
  
its been 15 years since I lost my wife and it doesn't hurt anymore, but my kid's death fucking hurts as that kid was nothing but great to me, not a single bad memory.  
  
Most of the times, the loneliness is very comfortable, but sometimes, on nights like these, it creeps in and let's me know it'll say for a while.   
  
Working feels good, it keeps me busy, it keeps my mind from remembering the good and the bad memories, the good and the bad in the world, the beautiful and the ugly. Too much beauty, too many good things and too many good memories can certainly unbalance a healthy mind in my experience, so work... just works, at least for me it does.  
  
I've traveled to pretty much every where I've ever wanted to go, I've got the time to attempt to solve every problem I ever wanted to face, I got to do everything I ever wanted to do and yet, I feel sad sometimes. thinking, i know what's the point, so why do I keep asking about something I've already explored from every single angle, do I do this to see if I missed something - and then rationalize why I am feeling that way.   
  
I've been to psychologists and psychiatrists, I've gotten massages, hugs, visited family, gone on dates - but nothing takes away the sadness that lurks from time to time.  
  
I sometimes like to tell myself that I own to humanity to keep fighting. Maybe it is what keeps me around, and maybe a little bit of curiosity of what will come next or when will happiness find me again, as it often does. I cherish the moments that I feel good. It mostly happens when I have a unique though or see something very beautiful I haven't seen before.  
  
Once everything has been seen and experienced, what is there to be done if not attempt to create novel, unseen sights and experiencing what wasn't available before? Seems only logical, yet hypothetical and not trivially executable.  
  
life is interesting, and for some reason, reminding myself that we are all made up of the same ""stuff"" as everything else helps me calm down - to re-frame the then distorted depressed view of reality into an amazing and epic journey. It doesn't always work, but talking about existence sometimes does.

I had fun during the journey and I am happy with where I am today, but it doesn't stop some lonely nights to punch me in my emotional stomach and puke in rainbow sadness, a color I like to think hasn't been imagine before, made to demonstrate the limitation of our own imagination.  
  
life is beautiful, but I don't always see it.   
  
I'll probably sleep and wake up feeling better, knowing very well that I can't cure every living being's body or mind from a much more horrific experience then my own - and that hunts me even when perhaps it shouldn't.

I hope I get better, sooner then later would be ideal, but not always is that the case.

Maybe feeling this way is a way to appreciate even more the times where these feelings aren't felt.

However and whatever all of this is, I know I won't quit, I won't quit on all of you and on all of us. Maybe saying this makes me feel better, but just know that this, it is true, no matter how I feel right now. 

Maybe that's what I needed in someone else, knowing that there is someone out there like me, that won't quit on you, even in their darkest hour.",depressed genius quite lonely today iq eq test almost forced take back ive written many research papers never published maybe leave existence next set alive beings kid died year ago wife years ago took life kid suffered rare disease kid hurt way business trip didnt think wouldnt back time take home hospital ended getting late even funeral good salary job demanding im mostly alone time ive got millions usd bank account could travel anywhere world eat whatever want whatever want sadness creeps sometimes ive written many research papers never tried publish ive never shared anyone honestly dont care sharing research done im sure many maybe anyone would understand driven ego driven curiosity ive tackled every single problem could find last years ive come terms every single one solution happy didnt solve always find fascinating someone else solves problem hasnt solved never published always read sort connect solved similarities differences always fascinating could retire want dont want give humanity existence universe quiet live isnt never never like tell im fine sometimes sadness creeps sucks ive met maybe people life mental capacity every single one like sense feels like never grew still kid inside curious everything fascination complexity turning impossible problems possibility loners months go without seeing anyone working solitude speaking anyone outside work hours multiple days dont say single word day years since lost wife doesnt hurt anymore kids death fucking hurts kid nothing great single bad memory times loneliness comfortable sometimes nights like creeps lets know itll say working feels good keeps busy keeps mind remembering good bad memories good bad world beautiful ugly much beauty many good things many good memories certainly unbalance healthy mind experience work works least ive traveled pretty much every ive ever wanted go ive got time attempt solve every problem ever wanted face got everything ever wanted yet feel sad sometimes thinking know whats point keep asking something ive already explored every single angle see missed something rationalize feeling way ive psychologists psychiatrists ive gotten massages hugs visited family gone dates nothing takes away sadness lurks time time sometimes like tell humanity keep fighting maybe keeps around maybe little bit curiosity come next happiness find often cherish moments feel good mostly happens unique though see something beautiful havent seen everything seen experienced done attempt create novel unseen sights experiencing wasnt available seems logical yet hypothetical trivially executable life interesting reason reminding made stuff everything else helps calm reframe distorted depressed view reality amazing epic journey doesnt always work talking existence sometimes fun journey happy today doesnt stop lonely nights punch emotional stomach puke rainbow sadness color like think hasnt imagine made demonstrate limitation imagination life beautiful dont always see ill probably sleep wake feeling better knowing well cant cure every living beings body mind much horrific experience hunts even perhaps shouldnt hope get better sooner later would ideal always case maybe feeling way way appreciate even times feelings arent felt however whatever know wont quit wont quit us maybe saying makes feel better know true matter feel right maybe thats needed someone else knowing someone like wont quit even darkest hour,4,2,Positive,Low Concern

1jq86ja,depression,1743650971.0,"How to trust myself again after self harming? This is something I desperately need advice on and something I can't find advice for anywhere.
People don't seem to talk about the fact that once you self harm for the first time everything completely changes. I think when I first did it my brains sort of went into a dissociative shock because we are naturally wired to want to avoid pain and injury and to value our lives but somehow my mind got to the point where I literally sat down and actively made the choice to cut my own skin.

I am past this now, it happened during the roughest time of my life and I didn't do it much but while not taking my anti-depressants properly | burnt myself really badly with a cigarette which has left a nasty scar and I cut my arm up for the first time in the same day (I had previously self harmed by cutting the tops of my fingers before). It was such a painful time and I'm not 100% sure why I did it. When I cut my fingers I think that was because I was annoyed at myself and wanted the marks to remind me how badly I want to change the way I am. And the cigarette was just because I hated myself so I didn't care what happened to me, and then when I cut my arm up that was after I suddenly stopped taking my antidepressants and I was super drunk so I don't have much memory but I genuinely think it was a desperate attempt to not commit suicide because I felt so pathetic and like the biggest loser ever and that the only thing I could do was attempt to release the pain by cutting or kill myself. Luckily I didn't die and I am very very happy I didn't kms.

I am in a very different place now but I worry that my brain will never be the same since self harming because the chemistry has changed or something and I can't perceive emotions as well as before. There's just something in me that feels numb although I feel emotions very deeply at the same time. An example though is how before I ever self harmed or even considered the possibility of doing it if I even thought about somebody self harming it would make me feel sick and horrified like a normal person.
Nowadays though I feel nothing towards it, I really want to and need to feel horrified by it again to make sure it never happens but I think then I would be horrified staring at my own arm and l'm not sure I can accept the level of what I did to myself.

My main problem is I feel like I have killed my inner child. The younger me feels like they have died now, I can't believe I did this to myself. I have so much guilt, I even hate myself for self harming. I feel like I can never be truly happy again because I am someone who has self harmed which is like the worst thing somebody could do to themselves apart from commit suicide I guess. I feel lonely. I feel unsafe with myself. How can I learn to trust myself again? To trust the person that hurt me, the person that hated me so much to do something I would never imaaine doina to anvone except myself. I feel like a monster to myself. How could I do this to myself. I was doing my best, all my problems weren't my fault they were normal self confidence problems and self control problems because of ADHD and somehow it led to sever delusion and body dysmorphia and self hate which then led to me cutting my own skin.

I need someone to help me believe that I can leave this in the past and see it as just a part of my life. I need help believing that my brain is not permanently fucked because of this. I am 100% confident I will never relapse again but I feel like the damage has been done and I feel unimaginable amounts of pain for the poor innocent happy child in me that thrived before people made me feel like a loser and I started hating the things that made me who I am.

Now that I'm an I dealt, it's all starting to make sense, all the moments I would zone out, isolate myself and sometimes just stay so silent even in very harsh situations. All the broken relationships, not feeling any connections with anyone.

These things built me into someone that I thought would conquer any hardship.

The isolation quickly started kicking back in, the addictions stopped working, the silence came back, overthinking and just too much but I still found a way which was simply knocking myself out with drinks or cannabis. 

This didn't work as well I guess because I didn't actually even know that I was avoiding my traumas and I lost my first two jobs and I acted like I didn't care at all. Not until I lost my most current job is when I realised I was fighting something serious.

Also I am physically weak so cannot do heavy farm work and everyone in village treats me like fool like talking to a child or someone with mental health issues.Should I try higher education or short term course?But with these many setbacks I lost complete faith in my learning ability because everyone doubts me and reminds me how useless I am.I can't go on like this forever and everyday I feel like part of me is dying everyday.I don't want to die but feel that instead of being burden on my family would it not have been better that I didn't exist at all?I feel that I am dependent manchild.How can I sustain my life and not be disappointment to my father?

1jq4m06,depression,1743640492.0,"Depressed due to unsatisfied sexual experience with wife. Hi all, good day,

I’m 36 and have been married for 7 years. During my 20s-30s, I was sexually active with ex-partners and never experienced erection/climax issues. Before marriage, I didn’t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.



In contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).



Over time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.



I also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy. I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance. We use sex toys, lubes etc, but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others.

I’m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges.",depressed due unsatisfied sexual experience wife hi good day im married years ss sexually active expartners never experienced erectionclimax issues marriage didnt intercourse inexperienced wife contrast involved experienced partnersprostitutes marriage heightened sexual expectations wife hesitant timid sex made intimacy challenging time currently rely heavily masturbation pornography averaging twice daily since escalated rough contents scat spy etc time wife developed better communication sex including watching porn together discussing kinks wonderful partner want start family however struggle sexual attraction toward often need think past partners fantasies feel aroused knows spoke gaps intimacy want start fresh also find difficult climax intercourse though says enjoys intimacy suspect pornography consumption may impacted libido performance use sex toys lubes etc never get lovely feeling like others im seeking advice rebuild sexual attraction toward wife improve intimacy addressing challenges,3,0,Positive,Low Concern

My dad just came back from the doctor. I'm not an expert, but I guess his heart isn't normal in some way, and he blames it on the stress that I cause him (which is probably true). So naturally, he does what's best for his heart and physical wellbeing, and yells his brains out at me as soon as he gets home. To be honest, I completely deserved it, but one thing that stood out to me, the same thing that stands out to me every time my dad gets angry at me, was how he blamed me for using my mental health to manipulate him. I promise you I do not overestimate myself or have an ego, quite the opposite actually, but I truly think that if 95% of other people were put into my position MENTALLY (meaning they have the same mental health issues and severities as me), they would handle it worse than I do. Nobody else, not even my parents, would believe me if I told them this, because my mental problems are 100x worse than what I express, because almost all of the time I'm able to hide my emotions and keep it a secret. Because of this, my parents think I'm just being lazy and not trying in life. Basically nobody knows how severe my condition actually is. Yes, I may manipulate my parents occasionally, but that is because my body has already been completely taken over by my thoughts. Most of the time they think I'm manipulating them ON PURPOSE / making my own situation worse, I'm actually doing the best I can, I just can't help it and my brain takes over. For example, the slightest things can trigger me, like if my parents give me a stern talking-to and a punishment,  I can develop suicidal thoughts. However, if I told my parents that I'm having suicidal thoughts, they would just think that I'm trying to use my mental illness to manipulate them and get out of trouble, but I'm not. My condition is just THAT bad, so i have to hold it in. In conclusion, I'm doing much worse than everyone else thinks, which means that I'm handling it much better than everyone else thinks.

1jq39ol,depression,1743636709.0,"What are people's experiences with Viibryd? TL;DR wondering whether Viibryd helped anyone?   
  
Hello All, 

So things in my life are going really bad. I would say that I hate myself and feel I have no future. Nothing that's not my fault of course, but still. I've been suicidal before but, never quite like this I feel. I have been planning a note, googling methods in some detail and thinking of plans. Honestly I totally would just kill myself (I see it as a very elegant solution to all my problems), but my issue is that I actually have many friends and family who love me. My girlfriend committed suicide about 4 years ago now, and that experience really impressed upon me just how dramatic the effects of a suicide can be on loved ones. So I'm investigating some alternatives to killing myself. I am trying to get back in therapy, but I am worried that won't be enough.

 I have Viibryd. It's at 20mg, but it was prescribed to me like, many years ago by this point so I'm sure it's degraded somewhat and thus isn't the same effective dosage. I have been very paranoid about SSRI's. What are people's experiences with Viibryd in particular? Did it have any lasting side effects (like even after taking it)?

1jq20zl,depression,1743633422.0,"I've been depressed for 17 years Hello all, didn't know what to do with the title but there it is. 
I'm 25 years old and I've been depressed since I was 8, I know this because I've been in mental health care since my 8th because I confided in my parents I wanted to die really badly. Ever since then I've been to multiple kinds of therapy, psychiatrists, psychologists and it has been years and years of almost nonstop working on myself and working trough things with proffesionals. Alot has happened before my 8th which probably made me feel that way, and by the time I turned 18 I heard for the first time that it also runs in the family. 
But after my 8th more and more stuff kept happening in my life, when I was 8 I had a tough family-home life, lots of dysfunction, lots of things happening around an 8y/o that shouldn't have, by the time I was 12 I started hurting myself, making plans to end it all (all this time being in multiple types of therapy), at 13 I got put on meds, which turned me into a zombie so they got stopped once I turned 14 all the while the family disfunction was still majorly disfuntioning, around my 15th we suddenly very quickly moved to a faraway place, away from all the friends I had made trough the years, away from all that I had built up for myself, away from my home and heart. 
I was the only one of my siblings having to move with my parents because my brother and sister were older and had already moved out. The first months living in the new home it was winter and we didn't have any power, heating, shower, and all the basics, and I was too far away from my friends to be able to go over, I turned 16 in that house at the time we just had a makeshift shower in the middle of the living room, still no heating, no flooring, no one around me except for my new classmates, who I sadly couldn't connect with because I was so distraught and hurt from what happened. 
Few weeks after I turned 16 my mom suddenly up and left, mom and dad were arguing alot even before the move, but mom left cause she found out dad was cheating over the phone, dad was working all day so I was home alone a lot of the time there. Short while after that they started a divorce and one night I was broken up with over the phone by my then-boyfriend, through his best mate telling me, and to not contact him at all ever again, I was totally done with everything and messaged my ex: ""if you don't reply I will kill myself"" I know, very stupid. 
This made the cops show up at our door at 3pm, because ex had called them for a welfare check (I don't blame him for that), cops gave me an ultimatum: ""you either go into closed-assisted-monitored living right this moment, or you stay home and promise us you will be okay and safe"" I wanted to get the hell out of the house, so I stupidly chose to go for the first option. Days later I called my dad, remorseful of what I chose, we had a 5 hour conversation with 2 psychiatrists, my dad, and me, and I could leave the place on one condition: I could not live at my dad anymore, we had to find my mom and I had to come live with her. 
She lived at her mom's house (my grandma) by then, so I went there. After a few months we found an appartment, and after living there for a month, my grandma died, the one we lived with, my always favourite person ever, giving me and my mom a ton of survivors guilt, we felt responsible for her death cause of the stress we brought into the home. From my that moment (16-18) it was all a blur of smoking weed, hanging around with the wrong people, got 🍇d by 3 people I considered friends, all this time I was still in full time mental health care. I got an abusive bf, let him stay with me and my mom for 2 years, got into a special school for people that left school early, and broke up with the abusive bf at my 18½th, and I started a new relationship which would turn out to be mentally abusive too, although I didn't see that at the time. 
When I turned 19 I went to live on my own in a kind of student-frat house, that bf stayed over 1 night, 2 nights, and then never left my room, didn't have the guts to kick him out, love is blinding. That relationship sadly lasted for 4 years, way too long in hindsight, but hey, that's always 20/20.
Somewhere in the time I lived in this student-frat house my brother fell through a glass roof, breaking his neck and a ton of other bones, we were told really quickly to start planning a funeral since his chance of survival from this was almost non-existent, but by a fucking miracle he recovered, a month of induced coma, 2 months of recovery in the hospital, learning to walk, learning to talk, learning to remember, having tons of brain damage, having revalidation for months after that and again by a fucking miracle we got back almost all of him (he is even driving his car again now in 2025, still can't believe it).

When I turned 22 I finally broke up with this boyfriend that never left my room, one month after that the whole studenthouse got evicted, so I had to find a living place quickly. And with 5 days left until eviction, I found a room, albeit illegal living, but anything had to do. I got to subrent from a good friend of me and my siblings, he was a 50+ year old loner so to say, but the greatest sweetest guy you could ever meet. I got to live there for two years until I was 24 and a bit, and then he passed away from a heart attack, this hit hard, he had become my best friend in a way, my go-to for any issues, life advice, the person home when I was at my lowest, and one thing beside that: it meant we (also 2 housemates) had to move out within a month, again, while grieving the loss of our dearest friend and housemate. I found an appartment, 3 weeks after eviction, I got to stay at my sister in the meantime. 
In this appartment I recently turned 25, still in full time mental healthcare, grieving all of the above, I am now 1 month and counting clean of smoking weed, I am studying in a field I don't even know if I want to work in.


This was the huuuuge backstory, because the only reason I started writing this is because: I am SO done, still, and again.


I know I won't kill myself, I have gone through it too many times to even think about it. But here I am in my own home, which is too expensive but I don't want to lose it, I have been crying myself to sleep every night, and because I am at the one-month mark of stopping weed I get even more heavy vivid dreams than I've already always had (I never stopped dreaming even with the weed). 
I am acquiring debt but also working to make that go away. I am trying so hard to finish this study so my school debt will be that little bit smaller to pay off, and so I'll feel like I have achieved at least something.

But to be honest having so much years of uninterrupted depression is really heavy, and it's chipping away at me, constant healthcare, constant feelings of nothingness, constant new diagnoses, new bad things happening and a new thing since two years: anhedonia. 
I never thought 3 years ago I would've ever said this but: I'd much rather have manic episodes than feeling nothing at all, I used to have so many hobbies, so many interests, something could always make my day or life that 0.1% better or bearable, but now since a few years I just feel nothing.

But I will never say mental healthcare doesn't work, cause I know I would be way worse off (if not dead) if I hadn't had it. Starting medication again in a week, and to be fair I'm fucking scared, but it's really needed now.


Don't know what my goal was with this, but I'll post anyways. Thanks for those that took a long time to read this ""bible"".

1jq2duw,depression,1743634354.0,"How to talk to parents about an emotional support animal 
I am currently 22 and  studying in university.
 
I've been struggling with severe depression for years now and it affects every aspect of my life and is so insanely soul crushing. I'm especially destroyed by the loneliness, I'm unable to talk to people and have essentially no friends (I've been this way for a long time and there's no quick way for me to make friends. Not looking for help in this department). Anyways the main point is I feel a lot of my pain comes from my loneliness .  (Also I've been on medication for ~7 years now and have tried every one in the book and am currently on a cocktail of 3 different ones right now, but it's never been enough.)

It feels almost every week I'm fighting off suicidal thoughts, but overtime it's gotten harder and harder. Every aspect of my life suffers because of these feelings.

I genuinely believe with my whole heart that if I had an emotional support animal, it would make the world of a difference. Just having a creature to take care of, something so I'm not alone, a creature who I can love and interact with who will love and interact with me. I have been able to get pet mice and they make a world of a difference, maybe the only reason I'm still around. But unfortunately they very much are prey and although a few of them tolerate me and even like playing with my hand, theyre a far cry from an emotional support animal.

I absolutely qualify for one where I live. But here is the tricky part:

The house I live in is a student house,which my dad owns (so I only pay half rent). But because of that the landlord tenant agreement doesn't hold. And so if I did get a pet without his approval, he would kick me out. ( In my city rent for a room in a student house could be ~$700-1500) And so, that is obviously not worth it.

But my dad is not heartless, I think if he knew how lonely I felt, and that having a cat or another support animal would make me feel better he would understand.

However the last thing I want to do is tell my parents I feel this way. It will only make me feel worse. They have an idea about it as they know about the medications I'm on, but I always play it off and say it's mainly anxiety and nothing to worry about.

I really do not want to tell them how desperately alone I feel. Knowing them they will blame themselves and go out of their way to support me which would make me feel even worse and more like a burden so I am so incredibly hesitant upon doing that.

How can I go about talking to my dad about my need for an emotional support animal without:

a) seeming like I'm using it as an excuse to get a pet

b) open up entirely and change our relationship forever

1jq2bd2,depression,1743634168.0,"A little rant about my shit life if you care 16M here from the UK. GCSEs are around the corner and I can't stop stressing about it. Even tho my mocks were pretty decent it's still just a meh for me and want better but every time I try to revise, I end up doing very little or just revise in the laziest way possible.

It feels like I'm a punching bag. It feels like everything is against me and every time I stand up for myself I end up getting into more shit. Like just today I was called a clown by a teacher aggressively just cuz I was standing close to a ""dangerous alley that could kill me cuz the building next to it has a high voltage circuit"" I've seen too many people actually go into the alley and the only thing that happened was Isolation, the building also literally can't do anything cuz all of the wiring is inside and it's a bricked building that's locked. Another thing that happened today, a girl and her friend group (who's been racist and hating on me for like 6 months ish because of literally nothing) splashed water on me and my 2 friends, then I splashed paint all over the main person for payback on the water and racism and now I'm probably gonna get isolation and if the paint doesn't come off ima have to give her money for new clothes and stuff

I've tried my best to just accept it's how life is. I became apathetic quite a while ago and even tho I made me very chill, my life just became boring and felt pointless. I've tried drinking and it actually did help me which is why I have a drinking problem. I don't just down like 9 shots and black out, I just drink a little bit so that I get tipsy and that's it. Today I found out that all of the alcohol's gone and since then I just can't stop thinking about drinking. I also don't play any games cuz the only computer I can use is an old asf computer my dad got in like 2011. I do have an Xbox and a Wii but my parents just don't understand technology and I don't have the cables and stuff to use it. Even if I did there'd only be 1 game on the Wii and like 3 on the Xbox. I just hate life cuz everything is broken and unfair. I have ADHD Combined and Autism and I tried to reach out for help but no one did. I hate everything and I don't even care if I do something illegal. Not like kill anyone or something but like smoke weed or go to some forest. There's too many things I've done that I just can't stop thinking about and the more I do the more I regret it. I don't even jump anymore I just sit there and stare. Even some of my friends, I'm scared that I'm gonna piss them off and then they're gonna come after me and kill me. My mum is over protective and even tho I understand what she's trying to do it's just so annoying it pisses me off. I've also become more of an ""okay"" person than a ""let's do this"" kinda guy. I can't even cry anymore, every time I try it just doesn't happen. I barely hang out with friends and go out which made me very lonely. I want to be beaten up and stuff. I get pissed off easily. I just want to escape reality",little rant shit life care uk gcses around corner cant stop stressing even tho mocks pretty decent still meh want better every time try revise end little revise laziest way possible feels like im punching bag feels like everything every time stand end getting shit like today called clown teacher aggressively cuz standing close dangerous alley could kill cuz building next high voltage circuit ive seen many people actually go alley thing happened isolation building also literally cant anything cuz wiring inside bricked building thats locked another thing happened today girl friend group whos racist hating like months ish literally nothing splashed water friends splashed paint main person payback water racism im probably gonna get isolation paint doesnt come ima give money new clothes stuff ive tried best accept life became apathetic quite ago even tho made chill life became boring felt pointless ive tried drinking actually help drinking problem dont like shots black drink little bit get tipsy thats today found alcohols gone since cant stop thinking drinking also dont play games cuz computer use old asf computer dad got like xbox wii parents dont understand technology dont cables stuff use even thered game wii like xbox hate life cuz everything broken unfair adhd combined autism tried reach help one hate everything dont even care something illegal like kill anyone something like smoke weed go forest theres many things ive done cant stop thinking regret dont even jump anymore sit stare even friends im scared im gonna piss theyre gonna come kill mum protective even tho understand shes trying annoying pisses ive also become okay person lets kinda guy cant even cry anymore every time try doesnt happen barely hang friends go made lonely want beaten stuff get pissed easily want escape reality,0,1,Negative,High Risk

Every day, I cry for different reasons, and every month, I think about death. I can’t handle anything anymore. The only reason I’m still able to write this is probably my parents’ expectations—it’s not even my own hope for anything, just the idea that they expect me to have been born for a reason.

So, why is this happening? I experienced a small amount of stress every day at my old school, and it all built up. In the end, I just stopped reacting to stress altogether. My brain decided to protect me by making me feel nothing, as if that was the safest option.
	2.	I can’t talk about my emotions to anyone. Right now, I’m trying to gather the courage to slowly drop hints to my mom that something is wrong. One day, I plan to tell her everything that’s going on. But in our family, it’s not common to talk openly about depressive thoughts. Things like therapy and psychologists just aren’t a topic of discussion.
	3.	I feel like I’ve lost my personality. At my old school, I had a group of friends, but they were very toxic and hated anyone who was even slightly different. I used to be really annoying but at least fun—I had a sense of humor and an open personality. But now, I’ve become much more closed off.

I’ve already spent five months in my new school, but no one knows me even 10%. They just know my name and a few surface-level things about me. And yet, I talk to these people almost every day. It’s like I’ve lost my humor, and there’s nothing left of who I used to be.

I don’t think this will ever end, and soon, I’ll leave this life. I’m tired of dying inside every day just to feel human for 10 minutes. There’s no one I can talk to who would truly understand me. I’m slowly, very slowly, starting to trust my mom, but it’s taking a long time.Plus,my new friends thinks that im biggest gatekeeper,but i just dont feel like they gonna be my friends after graduation,they are like mediocre 

Right now, it’s 2 AM, and I think I’ll be crying about my miserable life until 4.

Oh, and one more thing—I’ve started feeling really strange, like I’m not really here. My body is here, but my mind, my thoughts, and my emotions are somewhere far away. Either in the past or the future, but never in the present

1jpz69v,depression,1743626297.0,"*LONG* VENT: I am unable to do anything. Hello, I'm a depressed 20 year old nonbinary person with ADHD and autism. I've been depressed for 10 years. 

I recognized today that I'm at my lowest again, because I'm basically just trying to pass the time and not think. This post is about what happened today and I just need to vent about it cuz I feel like a total loser. 

I overslept today, which caused a domino-effect where I decided to not go to my lectures (as I had already missed ""everything important""). Mind you, I have 6 missed lectures of Microbiology, 3 lab raports months overdue, and multiple other lesser assignments that I should/could have focused on. 

I now realized that I'm back in the loop where I am a prisoner in my own body, constantly thinking about the fact that I have important things to do but not doing anything about it. Instead I sit in front of my PC all day, not eating anything but breakfast and then drinking a few energy drinks and playing videogames from morning to sundown. 

After I just shut my PC off I just feel awful, even though I made huge progress in the game. I'm not sure if I enjoyed it? I think I did, but... At the same time I feel like I didn't enjoy anything. I just kept playing. I thought about my responsibilities maybe around every 30 minute mark after 2-3 hours of continuous playing. I thought ""just this next thing and then I'll get up and do it"". 

I finally was able to quit the game because I'm going to have to try and go to the university tomorrow to avoid gaining too many absences (so I need to get some sleep), but I'm now *AFRAID* of the possibility that I oversleep and do nothing all day again. If that happens, I'll just end up feeling terrible again. 

I want to make a statement that I do not believe I'm addicted to videogames at the current moment. An argument could be made for me being addicted back when I was around 13-16 years old, but now I feel like this is not addiction to any game but rather just the fact that it was the easiest thing to do to pass the time. It also gave me momentary feelings of joy when I beat more and more bosses. For example: When my computer was taken away when I was ~14, I cried and screamed. I don't believe I'm as attached to video games currently. 

I don't know how I can get away from my depression and the constant executive dysfunction. I just wish I could actually close the game, get up from my chair and start working. My room looks like a mess again, and it's another one of those things that lets me know I'm in a bad place. Most of my life I've been able to function with my depression and also the fact that I have ADHD and autism, but there are times where I notice I'm barely scraping by. 

I truly feel like this might be a turning point for me. I believe this is one of the worst crashes I've ever had after binging any type of enjoyable activity. 

After reading my own ramblings now, I realize I have to show this to the healthcare professionals I've been working with. There are so many things that I feel like I'm able to say now, when I'm saying it to a faceless audience of people on Reddit. Maybe it's because I don't believe anyone is going to read ALL of this, if any. 

I'm going to fix my situation. I'm going to try. I'm not going to give up. I can do this, with the right help. I even feel a little better now that all of this has been let out. 

I hope you have a wonderful day.

I wanted to watch the world burn, hated everyone and everything, but I wasn't textbook depressed, I have fun with my hobbies and stuff, but I got bored now and watched the last good thing after years of obsession, and now there is nothing left, everything is just for the masses, the themes I like don't even exist, I realised after seeing real art again, everything feels empty. . I could just make it myself, It would just be confirming that nobody like me exists in this world, that I'm all alone, I cry. I wore out and slept in the same clothes for a week, I skipped my classes because I just couldn't be bothered to get out of bed and wasn't bothered to make a single excuse, I think I heard a mouse under my bed last night for the first time but everything sucks so much it's like a drop of water in a housefire anyways (I'm powerless, I can't fix the infestation because nobody else does anything, like everything in this rotten world), I haven't cleaned my room in a while, I was going to do it today, but it's already evening, time passes in a way that doesn't make sense anymore. I never did these things before, I didn't think I could care this little, I never understood people living in cockroach nests, but a few years of this is probably how it happened. I bought a knife some time ago, even if something bad happens there's no consequences, even if I lose another thing in my life I don't care so I don't take care of myself or responsibilities, I can just ""fix it"" as a last ditch effort if it gets bad enough, which it hasn't yet.

I'm not anti work at all, but seeing that you now need a master degree and talking 4 languages fluently to work at a supermarket is a little bit too much + AI is unpredictable and you might be studying a field where you'll be replaced some years after (finally) getting a job.

I never genuinely thrived in anything since my childhood even if I wasn't depressed at all. I always felt like I wasn't normal and that I was abnormally struggling with easy things like expression or making choices.

For those of you who feel the same, I need some advices about how to continue to live while carrying that burden.

all of that to say ive been working hard for the last few years to set myself up for my future and still maintain my own life through work and school. 

i turn 24 this year and my dad mentioned one of his friends offering me first dibs on the town home he’s selling. this is the first time we’ve talked about moving out, and im pretty sure it triggered me. i started thinking about how much i dont want to stay where ive always lived, meaning i dont see the point in dropping all my savings on a place when i could travel or move somewhere else and live life. then again, where would i even go? i have this idea of the world and opportunities but im convinced that would not work out for me.

it made me start to think about how little ive actually achieved? and how i genuinely have no clue what i actually want to do or what the point even is anymore. get my own place for…independence and to throw all the money i make into paying bills or whatever while im still trying to move my way up in jobs? i would literally be stuck here and have to start all over in terms of savings, while yes i would have my own place, but i have a really healthy relationship with my parents so i barely see the need??? im not even sure what im doing anymore bc tech is definitely not my passion but it feels like the only choice since im growing up and wasted the last couple years of my early twenties working it away and doing nothing of substance really.

suicide is the easiest answer. like seriously i wouldnt have to worry about how much is in my savings account, applying to jobs, figuring out wtf im doing bc im an adult now when i dont see my life amounting to much else honestly.

1jr6glq,SuicideWatch,1743752903.0,"Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk 4256 

16M

     I’m not sure how to manage anymore. I’m a sophomore in highschool, I turned 16 in early March. I guess I thought that once I reached my birthday things would ‘magically get better’. Something about time healing and being granted the freedom of leaving whenever I wanted. All of that ‘imagine life when I’m older’ shit. 

    In reality, I couldn’t feel more trapped. It seems as if things have been on a sharp and irreversible downwards spiral since August of last year. I’ll admit, I’ve always been somewhat of a troubled kid. Maybe it’s the aftermath of being locked in dog kennels and denied affection as a child, or maybe I was just born with a heart full of anger and disdain towards the world. Skipping school, smoking pot, nearly offing myself and ending up in the emergency unit on Father’s Day of 2021. I won’t sugarcoat it- I’m not exactly well behaved. 

   That doesn’t mean I consider myself a bad person. Well, sometimes I’m not sure where my soul truly lays on a moral scale. I’ve done things I’m not proud of outside of the typical ‘rebellious teenager’ activities. Losing friends in harsh manners due to my own unpredictable actions, saying things I’m not proud of, burning any semblance of a relationship my mother aimed to build between us. I don’t consider myself a bad person, but I would go as fast as to say I’m one of the good ones either.

   Nevertheless, I can’t bring myself to understand what I must have done in my life to deserve the way it is now. I’m queer, and there’s no denying that. It’s something I’d worked tirelessly to keep under wraps for the past 5 years of my life ever since I learned that there was a term for the way I felt- and a ‘correct’ response pushed by my family that I should have to it. 

   Back to August of last year- this all ties in, promise-. I had an especially rough fallout with a friend, and they ended up reporting an incident I confided in them about to my school. I’m not saying what they did was wrong, but it certainly ruined my life. The morning I found out I stayed home from school vomiting from panic attacks and clinging to the only comfort provided to me from a stranger hundreds of miles away. I nearly ended it that morning, downing half a small bottle or roughly 4000mg of prescribed high strength painkillers. It didn’t do anything, though that’s likely due to the fact I had quickly vomited the majority up with all of my hysteric wailing. I wish it had worked. 

   The report to my school destroyed everything in my life. Though it wasn’t the original contents of the report, it outed me and nearly exposed everything I was feeling to my parents. I’m not even sure how I kept parts of it from them, it had to be some kind of miracle paired with sobbing pleads to my guidance counselor. But they learned enough that my dad pulled me aside and told me if he ever caught me in the act of cutting myself he would beat me black and blue and called my scars he had previously been choosing to ignore disgusting.

   Kids at school found out that I’m gay. It’s been hell ever since. Everyday is relentless torture. I’ve lost all of my friends. I can’t even walk down the hall without having slurs shouted at me or being shoved by the shoulders through doors or against walls. Last month someone I didn’t even know ran up behind me and threw a mixture of rotting pigs blood (from our forensic labs cadavers) and borax in a pill bottle all over me. Im terrified to go to school everyday. Terrified that the bullying will get worse, or that my friend will report me again for whatever reason despite the fact we’ve cut all contact. I live in constant paranoia of him and my own actions.

   I can’t report any of the bullying. My life is already ruined enough. If my parents found out my life would be over quicker than I could end it myself. I genuinely don’t know where to go from here, and the only logical option seems like killing myself. I wish my friend had never reported me to my school. He ruined my life, and I think the worst part is that at some point I may have loved him and a part of me wishes he would reach out and we could go back to the way things were. I’m not sure why, deep in my heart I hate him. I’m scared of him and what he caused, but since I’ve lost all my friends my mind can’t help clinging to the memory of comfort associated with him before it all. I just want it all to be over. Intentional or not, he took everything from me. All I’ve ever asked of my friends is to never report anything I do or say since I warned them beforehand how much it would worsen my situation and put me in so much more danger. It seems like this is the only way out.",thanks coming ted talk im sure manage anymore im sophomore highschool turned early march guess thought reached birthday things would magically get better something time healing granted freedom leaving whenever wanted imagine life im older shit reality couldnt feel trapped seems things sharp irreversible downwards spiral since august last year ill admit ive always somewhat troubled kid maybe aftermath locked dog kennels denied affection child maybe born heart full anger disdain towards world skipping school smoking pot nearly offing ending emergency unit fathers day wont sugarcoat im exactly well behaved doesnt mean consider bad person well sometimes im sure soul truly lays moral scale ive done things im proud outside typical rebellious teenager activities losing friends harsh manners due unpredictable actions saying things im proud burning semblance relationship mother aimed build us dont consider bad person would go fast say im one good ones either nevertheless cant bring understand must done life deserve way im queer theres denying something id worked tirelessly keep wraps past years life ever since learned term way felt correct response pushed family back august last year ties promise especially rough fallout friend ended reporting incident confided school im saying wrong certainly ruined life morning found stayed home school vomiting panic attacks clinging comfort provided stranger hundreds miles away nearly ended morning downing half small bottle roughly mg prescribed high strength painkillers didnt anything though thats likely due fact quickly vomited majority hysteric wailing wish worked report school destroyed everything life though wasnt original contents report outed nearly exposed everything feeling parents im even sure kept parts kind miracle paired sobbing pleads guidance counselor learned enough dad pulled aside told ever caught act cutting would beat black blue called scars previously choosing ignore disgusting kids school found im gay hell ever since everyday relentless torture ive lost friends cant even walk hall without slurs shouted shoved shoulders doors walls last month someone didnt even know ran behind threw mixture rotting pigs blood forensic labs cadavers borax pill bottle im terrified go school everyday terrified bullying get worse friend report whatever reason despite fact weve cut contact live constant paranoia actions cant report bullying life already ruined enough parents found life would quicker could end genuinely dont know go logical option seems like killing wish friend never reported school ruined life think worst part point may loved part wishes would reach could go back way things im sure deep heart hate im scared caused since ive lost friends mind cant help clinging memory comfort associated want intentional took everything ive ever asked friends never report anything say since warned beforehand much would worsen situation put much danger seems like way,0,1,Neutral,Low Concern

Two years ago kissed a guy with the worst breath.
Got a fever and permanently fluctuating swollen painful tonsils (no COVID, no fatigue)
4 months later I developed digestive issues, gas chamber gasses after eating a home made brownie, later so many things gave gasses, clearly small intestine.
Gasses disappeared.
Developed chronic green diarrhoea 
Started with urgency / infectious / but mostly just once a day.
Got dehydrated
Kidney pain 
Lost 10 kilo quickly, Underweight
Blood sugar crashes
Faint
Scared
EXTREME HUNGER 
But I was never sick, never tired.
Got a bit better to just one daily fluffy stool.
Never in pain.
Sometimes completely undigested diarrhea was followed by total symptom relief up to 3 weeks.

I was trying to get help, because it felt like an active infection.
It was just anxiety they said.
Second Docter: ""no you dont have swollen tonsils"" "" I just told you I HAVE PAIN IN MY JAW AND TONSIL"" ""wrong office girl, you need a gi""

It wasn't júst that anxiety I knew it.

One and a half year later.
Tried to get help at a orthomolecular gut therapist. Said I had SIBO.
I do not have sibo.
Advised me to take a stomach acid booster pill.
Destroyed my stomach and stomach closing muscle. It was making painful spasms. My whole diaphragm hurted like knife stabbing.

With burning my stomach I HEALED MY SWOLLEN PAINFUL TONSILS AND ERADICATED DIARRHEA.

I THOUGH I WAS SAVED.

Had perfect shits for days.

Developed acid reflux a few days after the stomach muscle spasms.
Took stomach acid suppression.
Healed my stomach muscle pretty quickly.
Got an endoscopy.
Destroyed my delicate healing stomach muscle extremely. Back to hell.
Got way more reflux than I had (non acidic)
Stomach suppression made my stomach stop working, food lingering in my stomach for hours.

Developen LPR (non acidic stomach contents destroying upper throat and airways.

Haven't been able to lay down and rest for two months. Acid will destroy me.

Stomach muscle is broken. I feel it spasm when it wants to close. It self destruct due to protein digesting stomach enzymes digesting my own flesh, lungs, tongue, airways, vocal chords.

Stopped stomach acid suppression. In the hope I rebalance.

I am fighting to get better for so long. I can't handle it anymore.

Lost the love of my life a week ago.

I love life. But I might rather die soon.

1jr5j7a,SuicideWatch,1743748891.0,"Drop out of graduate school and join the army out of desperation, risking dying in it or killing yourself Hello everyone. I have lived on this planet for 23 years and I have realized one thing. Life is absurd, cruel and unfair. All these childhood illusions have crumbled like a house of cards since my teenage years. Perhaps someone here has heard of ephilism or read such philosophers as Schopenhauer, Cioran, Liggotti, Mainländer. And now to the point. Now I am studying for a master's degree, I myself have completed my bachelor's degree in theology. At that time I was not free from all illusions, for some reason I tried, I was worried, in general, anxiety has accompanied me all my life. Let's not deny upbringing and genes, but also let's not deny an adequate rational reaction to a world in which everyone lies, consumes and lives in the illusions of stoicism and religious dogmatism. Also, in my country there are peculiar difficulties with education, finding a job, escaping from the army, etc. I am disappointed in literally everything.  The fifth year of higher education is exhausting, everywhere there is propaganda that you need to give birth, that you need to blindly believe in illusions, improve yourself. It did not lead me anywhere. I tried to forget by releasing music albums in the dsbm genre, I tried to live in a relationship, but this does not help me cope at all. Now I perceive education as a light version of the army, where you also need to humiliate yourself, write delusional notes and not get any output. I had the best diploma, but you know, it did not affect anything except false praise and the killing of my nerves. So. Now there is another senseless war. Naturally, I do not want to go to war. And I do not intend to kill anyone, besides, I am a vegan and mostly a pacifist since school. But I am so tired, afraid of work, afraid of uncertainty, running from the military registration and enlistment office, learning unnecessary bullshit.  I plan to go to the army for a year out of desperation, I heard many can't stand it and kill themselves or they die from abuse and stress. I myself have a heart defect from birth but the military registration and enlistment office didn't give a shit about it and I was the only one who was not given an exemption from service. In general, these thoughts have not left me for quite a long time.",drop graduate school join army desperation risking dying killing hello everyone lived planet years realized one thing life absurd cruel unfair childhood illusions crumbled like house cards since teenage years perhaps someone heard ephilism read philosophers schopenhauer cioran liggotti mainlnder point studying masters degree completed bachelors degree theology time free illusions reason tried worried general anxiety accompanied life lets deny upbringing genes also lets deny adequate rational reaction world everyone lies consumes lives illusions stoicism religious dogmatism also country peculiar difficulties education finding job escaping army etc disappointed literally everything fifth year higher education exhausting everywhere propaganda need give birth need blindly believe illusions improve lead anywhere tried forget releasing music albums dsbm genre tried live relationship help cope perceive education light version army also need humiliate write delusional notes get output best diploma know affect anything except false praise killing nerves another senseless war naturally want go war intend kill anyone besides vegan mostly pacifist since school tired afraid work afraid uncertainty running military registration enlistment office learning unnecessary bullshit plan go army year desperation heard many cant stand kill die abuse stress heart defect birth military registration enlistment office didnt give shit one given exemption service general thoughts left quite long time,0,2,Negative,Low Concern
1jr4xa4,SuicideWatch,1743746433.0,"I’m so scared Dog I’m caring for starts heaving and yet can’t throw up what it is… I can’t even care for a dog. Probably my last straw. If this dog gets seriously injured or worse under my care, I will do something drastic.
Why? Why is this dog my limit? I dunno. I’ve been feeling this way for months. I think ever since I had the realization I’m such a loser. I’m four years into community college and getting an associates that has no job prospects, and I have nothing lined up for me. I’m in credit card debt and my score is lowering. I have been unemployed for a year, my savings are at an all time low. My family keeps stressing me out and I swear I’m so stressed sometimes I worry I have hives due to how itchy I feel. I keep gaining weight, my skin feels dry and flaky. The only thing I have going for me nowadays is my stupid art, but I have no real passion anymore. Still remember years ago my mother called my art ugly. My own sister called them stupid. I suppose I agree with them.
I accepted this job because I’ve done it before. I’ve cared for this dog. And I needed the money, so I could do it.
But no… I don’t know what happened but I had to leave the home to do some errands. Came back and he started heaving. What did he eat? Why didn’t I tie him up? He’s gone into the trash once, did he do it again? What if something bad actually happens? Do I take him to urgent care? With what money? I heard if you don’t pay the bill in full they can keep your pet until you do pay. But I have no money. I can’t risk that. This isn’t even my dog. This is someone else’s dog. Isn’t it despicable that in such circumstances I’m selfishly thinking about my own money? Between money and a life, Im being selfish anyway. What a terrible person I am. How could I do this? I lost my own dog. I remember the grief and pain of that. You never truly forget it. Am I about to inflict that pain onto an innocent family? Because they foolishly let me take care of him? I’m about to ruin lives. They’ll hate me. Everyone will blame me. And they should. I did this. I’m responsible for this. 
Y’know… something I’ve told myself is how nice it is how independent I am as an adult. I’ve had many hardships. So many mistakes I’ve cleaned up myself. And I never ask for help. So many mistakes no one in my life knows I’ve done. Yet I fix it myself. No one knows. I get annoyed when people ask me to help. So I don’t ask others, it easier to keep it hidden. And this is my own responsibility too. I have to take responsibility for my mistakes. This dog got hurt under my care. So I have to pay for that. 
It’s a little freeing. To know all my problems will soon go away permanently if I take the final step. Who knows what lies ahead? 
I dunno anymore. What sucks the most is I have no one to blame but myself for this. I put myself into this position. All my decisions led up to this outcome. All my mistakes can cost a life. An innocent dog’s life whose only crime is being taken care of by an irresponsible person.
Oh if only my parents knew they would raise such a terrible person. They could’ve gotten rid of me and spared all this pain. 
I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I can barely type. I’m still with the dog. Checking every few minutes he’s still breathing. That he makes it through the night. He’s looking at me so innocently. Like he always does. I should’ve rejected this job. They should’ve let the dog be in a dog boarding place. Why did I accept this? I mess up everything I touch. I make things harder for everyone and everything. Now I’m about to mess up a family’s life. I can’t handle that guilt. It’s easy enough when the burden is just on me. But now I can permanently ruin others. 
I’ve never been super religious. I’ve been baptized sure, but now? I’m praying to every god out there this dog makes it. It’s one thing to face all this pain and suffering myself. I can always keep it inside. All I ask is that they spare this innocent souls life from my bad luck. Please let this dog recover and be healthy and happy like always. Please. Because if this dog gets injured, I will take rightful ownership of my mistake with my own life.

Today it hit me I never really processed how much trauma was dumped onto me, then how much blame was placed on me for not being able to handle life. I want to tell my story, the whole story at least once before I go. I never told anyone my truth because I was protecting some image I wanted to live up to. This post is going to seem very self righteous, but I've never told my story. To anyone. I was an attractive, smart, athletic young man born into the worst circumstances someone can be born into. My Mom was a mentally ill narcissistic hoarder and my Dad a broken alcoholic. I lived in filth my entire life, and my parents never cared about actually raising me and instead kinda just expected me to raise myself in a terrible environment. And they actively tried to hide how bad things were the few times they were questioned which shows me they knew what they were doing on some level. My biggest regret is never telling anyone how bad my home life was, because I probably could've made something of myself had I been raised in an even semi normal household. That's the hardest part. I was gonna go more in depth but it seems futile and pointless honestly. Imagine a filthy home with no love in it at all, being socially isolated for your first 13 years of life out of fear they'd lose me (which they would've if anyone knew how bad it was) and constant blame being thrown on you. I remember crying and begging my mom to clean and her yelling at and blaming me, an 8 year old at the time, for the entire state of the home. It's beyond fucked up. I'm just glad I got to experience love a few times, even though I was too broken to love them properly in return. I'm glad I got to experience real friends for a while before I lost them because again, I'm broken.. I really am.. I never knew what love looked like, but it was shown to me a few times by some beautiful people along my journey. I tried my best to be a good person but I fundamentally didn't know how to be because I was raised like an animal. I'm just rambling, but I'm glad I tried so hard for so long to make the best of the circumstances I was given. I feel like I really did, even though overall I'm a failure in life. This car ran on empty for so many years and yet I still experienced everything I wanted to outside of having a family, but I understand I will never be capable of that for many reasons.

This was originally suppose to be a journal of my life, but it turned into some personal stuff.

Currently, I'm in 8th grade. I'm pretty down right now since I got my measurements wrong on my piece of wood in Tech Ed class, so I have to now buy a new piece of wood to fix it or I'll fail the class. I don't really wanna ask my dad to go and buy me some wood just for a stupid class, but I have no choice. My health class is also pretty boring. We started a health project about creating a “healthy” restaurant. The food that we wanna add has to have food labels and details of why it's good, better, or best. My group partner doesn't really do shit for every class. No wonder he's failing almost every class, plus his simple grammar sucks. After school, I came back depressed and pissed. Later at night, I have suicidal thoughts or thoughts about going in the army so my life doesn't go to a waste. I also want to care for my family, I just am too shy to express that I really do care about them and the things they do. This night, I shed tears of confusion and sadness. I don't know what to do with my life. My hopes are to find my purpose in high school. The suicidal thoughts and thoughts of just life in general keep popping up in my head. Atleast forward testing is done, so I don't have to overthink too much. I do wake up tired and am half awake at school. My reaction time is becoming slower due to my sleepiness. I'm also unfit and ugly with acne. Life is just this harsh sometimes. That's why I play games to escape reality. It's matters of what's in the game, not what's behind the monitor. I can probably get some agreements with that claim. If you're still reading, Thank you. If I ever stop writing, it's either that I've committed suicide or I've lost the will to live.

It's been about 10 minutes. I've calmed myself by watching YouTube shorts. After that, I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. The thoughts keep me awake. “What would happen if I die? The people that know me, what will my death trigger in them? Do they really care?” These kinds of thoughts keep coming back everyday. When I think about trying to kill myself, I picture seeing my whole family sobbing. I just can't see myself doing it if that thought keeps reaching out. “What purpose do I serve?” I ask myself. 

Life has shown the darkest of days for me. Brighter ones I hope will show. But as I'm at the bottom of despair, the light won't shine on me.

I've attempted to sleep again. Tears keep pouring off my face. I don't know what to do. It's not like I lost someone I know or love. But it really feels like a heartbreak. Eyes dry as the California forests, but were soaked like a rock under a waterfall not too long ago. I still don't know why im even having suicidal thoughts over school.

Please help me stand up again.

Being homeless has made actively want to die for months now. But I can’t go to a psych facility for treatment or go to the hospital after because if I did, it would be an endless cycle. They’d have me put in inpatient, I’d lose my dog, and having no home and no dog to go back to would just make me continue to be suicidal to the point I’d never leave or I’d just end up right back there or dead. So far all the methods I’ve tried have ended up being non lethal (mostly pills) and I think it’s because I’m too scared for my dog to end up dead or at a shelter where she’ll likely be euthanised if I did a guaranteed lethal method.

1jr1onj,SuicideWatch,1743735116.0,"Last rights Hi everyone , my name is B and I think this story will be best told without names. Anyways this is my second official post on Reddit. I’m nearly out of my 20’s I just had a birthday pretty recently. That same day ironically I lost my job. I laughed it off in the beginning confident I could find anything else with the skill set I have. It’s been quite awhile with nothing to show. I still live with my parents (shocker). I’ve been single for god knows how long. On purpose I might add, minus the baldness I’m not too bad looking. For whatever reason I could be madly in love with someone then in the blink of an eye I could care less. So I purposely stayed away from relationships. Even though being alone is dreadful, it fails to compare to what I feel knowing the amount of pain I’ve caused in others. I’m not a bad person my heart was always in the right place. It’s just my mind that never will be. No matter what I’ve accomplished nor how happy I am I can not let go of how much pain I’ve inflicted. How little I’ve lived up to expectations set for me. Or how miserable the world seems. I’ve tried numbing myself with drink and smoke but nothing seems to work anymore. I’ve tried talking to people very close to me about how I feel and shockingly it was always brushed off by my parents. I haven’t brought it up in years since I was a teenager. It’s just funny when my sister had issues they sparred no expense getting therapy or whatever help she needed. I’m glad they did, I’m happy she got the help she needed. I’m not completely alone on this, I have came to my best friend several times about this . I just don’t want to bother him anymore, you know at some point it almost seems like “the boy who cried wolf”. I never wanted that to be a trait tacked on to me. I’ve even reached out to the suicide hotline a few times. Which bravo by the way, if there is ever a such thing as an “essential worker” it’s the men , women, etc. that are always taking the calls. Bravo. I’ve been researching the best path to take when I wanted to go off the deep end but the one thing holding me back is being an organ doner. Lol ironically, but a lot of “methods” damage vital organs or could render them useless once recovered. That’s odd it’s my reason, I see so many people posting valid reasons and points for why they haven’t. Yet I’m tied up on the logistics, the after effect. Completely fine with making the leap but held back because I still want to do some good beyond the grave. I don’t know, I guess I’m just posting this not attempting for any responses more or less just talking to talk. I just wish my head didn’t operate as it does. I wish it wasn’t so taboo feeling and thinking as I do. You know that’s another thing I mean I get it I’ve held onto a lot but overall I don’t really have any reason to feel the way I do? Strange I know but I don’t . I can’t explain it but it’s like I can feel the pain all around the world. It’s gotten to a point I can’t even open my social media or walk past a freakin homeless person without feeling overcome with dread and sorrow. Messed up part about all this is I believe the world has always been this way. Always been filled with all this hate and sorrow. I get it that if you only look for the bad that’s all you will find but good god it’s everywhere. Idk I just needed to vent. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

1jr0hty,SuicideWatch,1743731424.0,"Everything that has led me to do this. I guess I ought to say something about this. It shall go into an abyss, and my voice won't be heard, but I've got nothing to lose.

I'm very shy and don't talk to many people, this is all just going on in my head, the loudest voice ever.

I have/had the gym to silence that voice but even that is starting not to work anymore.

I don't have a good relationship with my parents and I honestly don't even have the energy to explain this part, so I will just say, my mom is with my stepdad, and he is an absolute tool. There were moments when I was younger where I thought he was trying to sleep with me. He would make such strange comments, and I am at least thankful to be away from it now, but the few times I went to the gym with him, he would say things like ""those guys are staring at your a\*\*"", ""you're looking very fit, it's noticeable."" there was a point where he presented a $100 infront of me and told me to take my pants off. He walked by my window one night and I was getting dressed and didn't realize (I mean who would in the privacy of your own room) but he came to my door and he said he saw me naked and commented on my body and said.. I had a perky chest. He manipulates my mom as well, talks badly about her, spends more money on himself then he ever would her. He's been with her for most of my life, so around 13 years (Im 21 now as of last month). He could have married her long ago but his excuse, and my mom believes this.. there are marriage laws that say if you're with a person long enough you're legally married.. blah blah, but there is no ring, she allows herself to settle and is just as delusional as him. He won her years ago and she will take his side over mine any day, and now I understand why my grandma never liked him as well, it makes me sick that she doesn't listen to me.

But she doesn't know. She's blind to it.

Im like, shaking and wanting to cry just typing that.

My DAD I don't have a good relationship with either, because he doesn't even care about much of anything, he has never carried to visit me much and will always try to convince me that its my moms fault that we aren't closer.

I don't know how to talk to people. I focus on myself so much and I just wait for other people to come up to me and start conversation. I get overwhelmed and my head is so loud telling me that these people don't have good intentions and I won't find/keep real friends. Especially other girls, I don't have other girl friends, I have social media friends. No one ever wants to go and do anything or hang out, they are always too busy, and im in COLLEGE where there is so much opportunity to make new connections. But for some reason im still alone. And sometimes I think the problem is me.

I lost my job because of a stupid mistake I made. (My fault)

My mom is threatening to pull me out of college because my grades are falling apart. (My fault)

I literally spent a night in jail, and almost didn't make it out of that because mentally I couldn't handle it. (Obviously my fault)

I had a recent fling with a Viet guy and it was very back and forth as to whether it was going somewhere serious or not, but we were together CONSTANTLY.. multiple times a week, back to back nights........ and afterward I tried to act like it didn't bother me but it did, it made me cry. I forget having emotions is normal but it feels like a very emotionless place. It felt like I was in high school when it ended. Just the way he treated it, so whatever about it, ""We should stop talking for now, youre getting too attached and I don't want to hurt you."" When a few days before that he wanted to get matching tattoos with me, but I think there was a different motive behind that.

I told another guy about this and he tried to make it less of what it was because hes just as toxic as the rest of them, he said ""Matching tattoos doesn't mean much, anyone can do that."", ""You're so stuck on him because he got you a stuffed animal and he wanted to get matching tattoos with you? I can treat you better."" Sure, but there IS meaning behind it. There WAS a reason he asked. But now thinking about it this guy used me too because he wanted to sleep with me.

They all do, they are men, but unfortunately I try to make friends with men because im desperate for connection (not love, friendship), but I know that is not possible because it's just not how the world works.

These past few weeks I've been drinking a lot more then normal just to silence myself and feel some kind of enjoyment. My family has a not-so-great history with alcohol, my grandma drowned in a pool when she was drunk.

The verge of my last straw was meeting up with a Korean guy and walking all over my campus just to find a place for him to \*\*\* all over my face. That made me feel so extremely low, and that was a moment where I wondered where all of my self respect went. In my mind I guess I was trying to fit in, most girls do only-fans, so why shouldn't I give men what they want? He wasn't even very cute for a Korean..

My last straw that has led me to do this just happened last night. I made an idiot of myself. I drank the rest of my vodka in my room last night, and in my drunken state, I messaged the friend of the guy who I was seeing months ago (the same guy I mentioned earlier, the guy from Vietnam); for some back story about him, he was curious about me when I was seeing other guy, they would both talk about me, other guy showed him my n\*\*es and he wanted to get in too. Tried to convince me that he cared about me, but he didn't, he DOESN'T. The problem is I really liked him, probably even more then other guy I was with, but I could never tell him that. They both wanted to have a 3-way with me. I wanted to do it just to be admired and feel something, but everything ended so soon. As soon as I stopped talking to other guy because 'I got too attached' and he cut me off, he lost interest immediately too, and I should have just stayed the fuck away. But I dug myself a deeper hole like I always do, and here we are last night, in my drunk mind, sad about the other guy, conflicted with his stupid friend, messaging him a bunch of yip yap. I don't even remember all of what I said because I was so embarrassed I tried to wipe it clean out of my head, but I know I sounded extremely desperate and crazy as fuck and it was just awful. He left me on read the entire time and seemed so uninterested but I just would not stop. 

I just can't live with this, on top of everything else that has happened, this pushed me over the edge, and I don't even want to show my face anymore.

My plan is to go to the top of one of the car garages here at the college, in the middle of the night so no one sees, and leap off. Maybe I ought to drink again before doing this, so at least I go in somewhat of a peaceful state.

People suggest therapy, but I don't want therapy, because it doesn't help. I wanted friends, connections, to not be or feel used. Everyone has a selfish motive. The world is different now. Unfortunately I do care about what other people think of me, I do want people to like me, don't be like me, it puts a really big dent in your potential.

I don't want to be alone, but I don't want to be used.

Money doesn't buy happiness. I bought my dream car, a bmw 650i 2014. At first, it was great. I was happy. But after a few days, it just became a car. Something to get me from place to place. I live on my own. I don't have any friends. I've never had a girlfriend in my entire life. I'm very lonely. All I do is work, work, work everyday.

Every girl that I've tried to get something going with has been a gold digger. All the girls that I've spoken with have used me. I personally think I'm not bad-looking, but girls these days only care if the guy is a bad boy, has guns, tattoos, smokes and a sixpack. That's all they care about. They don't care if a guy is loyal to them and can financially support them. All they care about is looks. All the friends that I've hung out with have used me for some type of gain. 

I feel that I've changed so much because of the money. I stopped being humble. I guess people have formed opinions about me. Now, most people think I'm daddy's money, that I've always been given, handouts by my supposedly rich parents, but I've made it all by myself. 

My main motivation in my life has been to prove people wrong. After high school, I didn't go to any university. All the teachers, all of my classmates said that I was going to fail, that I was going to end up just working at McDonald's. Even my parents, threw me out of the house. I was homeless. But now that I've shown my success in my social media, posted my car, posted the sales I've been making, all the cash I've been raking in, now I don't have any other motivation in my life.

1jr02ir,SuicideWatch,1743730128.0,"Life is strange I'm 25 years old. I'm posting here because the effort it takes to ward off feelings of suicide is becoming nauseating. I was born in a family who should have never had children, and not for reasons typical of abusive families. It's this strange gray area where from the top down any fuctional adult would understand how crushing things would become for me in particular. I feel like a fucking pussy for even putting the words to this in a cohesive passage but I've never been so compelled to make a confession.

Let me first say that I don't have any direct intentions of ending my life, at least not in the present moment. This is purely a cathartic effort toward trying to erase the feelings that sway in and out of my life on a completely regular basis. The passive ideation has been something I've fought against since I was young. That being said, it's a fucking monster of a feeling that grows dramatically each time it rears its ugly head. I'm giving as full of a context as I possibly can because I wholeheartedly don't even give a fuck if anyone reads this in its entirety, I need to let it out.

I was born to a woman and man who hated each other, a tale as old as time itself. My mother had a son who is 18 years my senior with someone who wasn't my father, and two years after me, my parents had another kid, my younger sister. My father fucking hated my older brother, and now than I've grown up I understand it was for good reason. If I gave the full context on that it would take actual days to type out, but the short end of it is he was an undisciplined troublemaker who put himself and my whole family at risk of being in serious harm on several different occasions throughout my entire life. For example I was too young to recall specifics here but there was some kind of incident where he owed some bad people money and they tried to kidnap my infant sister or something insane like that. All that aside, my father had raised me in a manner that suggested I was a ""bad seed"" just like my half-brother. This is where things start becoming strange.

About a year after my sister is born, myself being 3 years old, my mother and father attended some kind of friend's get together and left us with an aunt overnight. At this party, my mother suffered a near fatal head injury that changed the trajectory of all our lives completely. Skipping forward quite a bit, after months spent in the hospital and in physical therapy, my mother came home and was a noticably different woman. The details are hazy because I was a child, but the consensus of this all after growing up and talking with my extended family was that it was an attempted murder spearheaded by my father to either get rid of her completely or have her sent away because she owned half of his contracting business. I know how unbelievable this sounds, but my father was a maniacal man and there were instances in his life prior to me existing where this would make a lot of sense. 

A little more fast forwarding, my mother divorced him, and by the time I was 10 years old or so he lost visitation rights to my sister and I cause he couldn't stop abusing me. It's been about 15 years since I've seen him and I had never realized the detriment of not having a father figure until I grew up and was catapulted into the real world. Not only did I never have a man teaching me how to do man shit, the only person I had to teach me anything was a jaded woman who only had half her brain to work with after her injury. She also had a severe distaste and distrust for men considering all that had gone on with my father, all of the trouble my brother put us through, and the grim reality that she was raped as a teenager and that was how my brother came to exist in the first place. 

With my lifetime of a sob story watered down and out of the way, this left me vastly underprepared to take on adult life. I've been ridiculed and bullied out of just about every serious job I've ever had for my lack of experience and general common sense. I started a career in carpentry and went through so many layoffs in the span of 4 years that I lost my apartment and my car and even the girlfriend I had at the time who ended up having a kid with a stranger while we were arguing. I'm 25 now and I've had to move back with my mom, working a dead end job to dig myself out of the hole I fell into. I've been at it for a year, I've made progress, I've even gotten myself another car, but through all of it I can't keep up with the relentless balancing of ""things are going to be okay"" and ""I want to end it.""

This post is extremely lengthy, but I've never been able to express these feelings honestly due to how frequently my older brother would threaten to take his life to get attention from my family. I live in constant agony internalizing these feelings because I know there's not a single person on earth I can safely share this with. I'm trying so hard to learn a skill that will make me valuable in American life so I can survive on my own because all I've ever wanted was to be able to survive quietly, but things are starting to seem grim and nobody wants to give me the time of day. 

I kind of lost my way typing this out, I guess all I wanted to say was I admit that I am suicidal. I've been fighting the good fight for years but it's manifested into something that's equally as strong as my will to fight it, and it's always getting stronger.

Upon my discharge I received zero help in the community and was discharged from the crisis team etc without my input, I have since been pushing for help but not receiving it, it’s only the last month I have seen CMHT but they seem reluctant to put my on these antipsychotics as they said it’s a severe medication they want to avoid but I can’t have antidepressants because they haven’t worked in the past.

1jqtf8n,SuicideWatch,1743712411.0,"Ocd bad prayers This is somewhat messed up. It’s not all about ocd, but I do have it. I’ll try to explain as best I have it. I do have ocd and yes ocd can make you obsess about prayers. The issue is that this isn’t entirely ocd’s fault. Awhile ago, when ocd made me suicidal, I almost prayed for something terrible, and I’m glad I didn’t. My parents had left college, and I was feeling suicidal (due to ocd). The one thing stopping me was how devastated my parents would be. If they got into a car accident (this is awful I know), then I wouldn’t have that stopping me. 
I ALMOST prayed for this to happen but stopped myself. 

Fast forward months, and me realizing how close I came started an obsession over it. I eventually got into a full blown obsession over prayers. For some reason I wanted to be sure that if I did that, it would’ve been ok. So I started imagining I had. This led me to not feel great. Eventually, ocd started harping on what else I could pray for, or indirect ways I could pray for it. So it targeted topics that I would least like to pray for. The main topic that I was most afraid of praying for was racist topics. I will not get into all of the specifics, but there was a pathway it found where I could end up praying for something racist (which included a bunch of death). This worried me, especially because if my mind was in the right spot I could pray for it. Then, my ocd found the perfect way to make a racist prayer happen. It said to me “if all people of color suddenly died, you would be so distraught that it could basically cause you to commit suicide.” 

All of the sudden, I got worried about this, because I knew it was possible given that I almost prayed for my parents to die. Additionally, before this, my ocd found a way around actually praying for the first thing. I ended up praying to pray for it to happen. It’s sort of magical thinking, but when I prayed to pray for the horrible thing, I meant it. And technically that meant I meant all of the stuff in the prayer, even though I didn’t actually do the prayer. So all of the sudden, ignoring everything was not an option, and I was in a full blown obsession.

I consistently obsessed about how I prayed to pray for the awful racist thing. I knew there was a pathway for my brain to pray for it, so it was almost like I prayed for it without praying for it. The main issue started 3 and a half weeks ago, with the racist prayer. It was absolutely bugging me, knowing that I could mean it. Then, my mind presented me with a scenario. What if all people of color died in a way which was somehow not my fault, and I was magically not responsible for anything, including the prayer. I ended up praying for this and regretting it very quickly, but meaning it when I prayed it. And it was not because I hated people of color. It was because if that scenario happened (which I don’t want it to), it would be enough to push me over the edge for suicide. I instantly regretted it but meant it in the moment.

Fast forward to today, and this has been following me constantly. In class today, I was feeling suicidal, and the thing about my family dying popped up. If my family died, I would somehow have a pathway to attempt suicide. And the whole “what if you were not at fault at all” thing popped up. And I almost prayed for it. Same thing as the people of color thing. And it wasn’t just ocd intrusive thoughts. I wanted something to push me over the edge. I feel absolutely horrible about this, and me knowing how close it was to happening is really making me not feel good, because with magical thinking, I can easily get myself in that mindset and pray for it.

The worst part is this obsession with these prayers leads me to being suicidal, leading to prayers like this becoming more likely. I can’t escape the cycle of worrying about the prayers. If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t have this obsession at all. Especially with the racist prayer, but also the family one (which hasn’t happened but almost happened), it is making me feel like I either don’t deserve to live, or I deserve to suffer.",ocd bad prayers somewhat messed ocd ill try explain best ocd yes ocd make obsess prayers issue isnt entirely ocds fault awhile ago ocd made suicidal almost prayed something terrible im glad didnt parents left college feeling suicidal due ocd one thing stopping devastated parents would got car accident awful know wouldnt stopping almost prayed happen stopped fast forward months realizing close came started obsession eventually got full blown obsession prayers reason wanted sure wouldve ok started imagining led feel great eventually ocd started harping else could pray indirect ways could pray targeted topics would least like pray main topic afraid praying racist topics get specifics pathway found could end praying something racist included bunch death worried especially mind right spot could pray ocd found perfect way make racist prayer happen said people color suddenly died would distraught could basically cause commit suicide sudden got worried knew possible given almost prayed parents die additionally ocd found way around actually praying first thing ended praying pray happen sort magical thinking prayed pray horrible thing meant technically meant meant stuff prayer even though didnt actually prayer sudden ignoring everything option full blown obsession consistently obsessed prayed pray awful racist thing knew pathway brain pray almost like prayed without praying main issue started half weeks ago racist prayer absolutely bugging knowing could mean mind presented scenario people color died way somehow fault magically responsible anything including prayer ended praying regretting quickly meaning prayed hated people color scenario happened dont want would enough push edge suicide instantly regretted meant moment fast forward today following constantly class today feeling suicidal thing family dying popped family died would somehow pathway attempt suicide whole fault thing popped almost prayed thing people color thing wasnt ocd intrusive thoughts wanted something push edge feel absolutely horrible knowing close happening really making feel good magical thinking easily get mindset pray worst part obsession prayers leads suicidal leading prayers like becoming likely cant escape cycle worrying prayers didnt care wouldnt obsession especially racist prayer also family one hasnt happened almost happened making feel like either dont deserve live deserve suffer,1,1,Neutral,Low Concern

1jqksqu,SuicideWatch,1743692620.0,"When will i feel happy again? I'm an 18 year old student and have had depression for many years now.

My mom has been really sick for my whole life multible times cancer, heart failure, kidney fails and way more.

The bullying started when i was around 10,  it was all because of my weight and they were beating me up for it.
I had gained alot of weight as a child since money was really short, unhealthy food is cheaper than healthy. 
But when i got to the final year of primary school the bullies were gone and i made some friends.

Then i got to secondary school hoping it would be the same as last year but people started making pig noises when they walked past me and offering me food when they saw me. They would even beat me up.
After the first year of secondary school i got bullied so much that i started hurting myself, biting my hand, scratching open my legs and head beneath my hair biting my nails so they would be sharp to poke in my fingers and arms. 
I had a couple of friends at school they were nice to have around me i finnaly felt at peace but almost all of them left me.
I still had 2 friends let's call them EM and MR.
EM was my best friend since primary school and she was always there for me and MR was a good friend where i could hang out with.

The first 2 years were the same, bullied, beaten,  text that would get worse and worse and a sick mom. Contact between me and MR got less and less until we didn't talk anymore

When i got to the third year i had a girl in my class and i will call her PW.
I have had problems since i was a child with trusting people but i trusted her really quick and fell in love but didn't want to ask her out since i was scared she would say no or would leave me like the rest anf i also felt like if i did ask her and she would of said yes she would get bullied because of me.

I was planning to kill myself that year. I was acting distant to friends and being annoying so if i did kill myself they would be less sad about it. One of the friend i did this with was PW i started with lightly kicking her chair sometimes and just being annoying but she never left me she still wanted to talk. She saved my life that year she stopped me ftom letting go.
Later that year i got more and more friends and got back into contact with MR, life was going good and when i heard that almost the whole group was in the same class next year we all were exited. 
Year 4 was good nothing to complain about exept that i lost almost all contact with PW and when the exams came i was the only one not to make it, all my friend went and studied and i was still at the same school.
The group fell apart, i had no contact with EM anymore since she wanted to move on and have other friends.

I redid the year with no one to talk to about anything. My life at this point was: school -> game alone -> sleep.
At this point i was so tired of everything that i started cutting myself, starving myself and blaming myself until i did an attempt on my life that failed. I knew my parents were gone for the night and took alot of painkillers and cut deep in my leg but it wasn't deep enough when i woke up i saw alot of blood but it did not work and the wound healed over the next couple of days.
A month later i went to the train station with the intent to jump but i got pulled back by an older man i have no clue who that was and i still don't he did not say anything and i left. 
I kept cutting myself and couldn't look at myself in the mirror i felt like a nobody.

(I never change anything about my appearence since i feel like i will get laught at again. I do nkt cut my hair since last time i did i was made fun of the whole year. I do not wear other colors for clothing that i now wear since i am scared to be made fun of and all the little things about me.)

When that year finnaly ended i went and studdied now we are in this year. I saw a really old friend from primary school that i had not talked to in a long time and we got in the same class and life was getting better. 
I still got bullied but i did not get beat up anymore.
Eventually i saw PW again and we talked more over the year and i fell in love again but still couldn't bring myself to tell her that since i still felt like a nobody. So by my surprise she had asked me if i liked her too and i said yes.

I felt like myself again like i mattered. I could finnaly learn what is it to love myself. After years of depression, starving myself on some days and hurting myself someone saw me as me.

But today she broke up with me, she didn't feel the spark anymore that she felt like she now isn't ready for a relationship but still wants to be friends.

I can't blame her on how she feels but i wanted to tell her this story and still couldn't bring myself to do so. 

I feel bad again i have been giving myself the blame for it i keep thinking: i was not good enough for her, i should of cared more, ext.

Now i have been biting myself and scratching myself again in the last hour.

So i don't know what to do anymore and don't know how or what i want to do.

But one thing is certain i am still thankful for her because she is the girl that saved my life.



Ps: sorry for the spelling mistakes i have been crying non stop.

1jqklch,SuicideWatch,1743692155.0,"Hi! Not suicidal, but I think depressed. Would really appreciate concrete and direct advice about this situation! Thanks :D To be brief

- Almost died at birth due to sepsis, was given ototoxic medicine to save me, which it did, but in return since it's ototoxic it made me have 80% hearing loss
- Bullied most of school life

- Family's company failing when I was supposed to start uni, wasted 4yrs of life there (no benefits)

- Dad's recently started having screaming fits for no reason at everyone

- Going to uni finally but it's too late and going bad (I'm 25)

- I feel like I don't belong there and everyone's making it before me

- When I was getting bullied I started going to gym and tried to progress fast, was careful of form and everything but I still ruined my lower backs, got a nasty disc herniation and now it hurts non stop, had MRI and scans they said it's probaly for life and even with surgery it's not a real solution

- Was rear-ended last year and got whiplash and it started hurting more and more recently, went to dr and they're pretty sure it's another herniation now in by neck, MRI scheduled again, but similar prognosis to lower back

- Can't run anymore, can't really exercise in a way that relaxes you, only isolations that feel robotic, no will to even keep doing it anymore honestly

- Last year I spent my saved money on motorcycle to lift my spirits up, when I was riding in my school it's the rare things that made me happy and I was always at least motivated after that for a few hours to actually do things

- Unfortunately turns out that motorcycle was a scam and it had major issues

- Stored it in aunt's garage which ended up catching fire (stove caught fire)

- Motorcycle and money gone

- Not to mention even if they weren't gone my neck prevents me from wearing a helmet now (I tried, I get extreme pain with any load on head)

- Trying to do projects in CS, specifically with LLMs and Pytorch, other people are way better than me, better with math.

- Okay figures, it's solvable with money. Discs can be fused/replaced, exercise with therapist, try to relax and focus at studying and finding work

- Today dad has another screaming fit and threatens to kick me out of house

- Lower back and neck spiked up for no reason and it keeps getting worse

- I keep going to DR's but they keep brushing me off

- I went to local institute for disability to at least try to get disability aid, I don't want money I just want opportunity, I am ready to work

- They tell me my disability hearing isn't severe enough under new standard since it's ""easily fixed with hearing aids"". I pointed out they cost much much more than what they're giving and they said: ""you can submit appeal to federal level (country)"". I did and they keep destroying me by stalling it and demanding audits.

- Keep in mind in countries around me I would instantly get disability and even money, it's just that my country is corrupted (Bosnia) and they don't care, I'm not the only person with this problem. And for my backs they said its not even considered relevant since surgery can fix it. When I point out they do microdisectomy which has a high failure rate they sarcastically replied how do I know that, where's statistical data by a professional and audits and that I'm not even qualified to make these remarks.

&nbsp;

Local companies also don't want me because I:

- Keep getting ghosted after interviews (and I had only few too)

- They realize I don't hear well

- They notice I am a bit in pain when I sit down and as much as I try to smile and be motivated it's forced I speak with pain and hard

&nbsp;

Honestly it's not compassion that I need or understatement, I just need to figure out what do I do next? I don't need people feeling bad or saying: ""owie you're a fighter"" or ""keep grinding bro"" etc, because honestly if we're going to be real it keeps getting worse and I keep decaying and I don't see really what else is left to do.

I thought about going to media and just writing random letters everywhere about my problem and seeing if it sticks anywhere but I have no idea even where would I write or if anyone cares.

I had a awful job that pulled my ADHD to its very limits and I just got fed up with it and stopped showing up so they fired me, which isn’t what’s bothering me. I can always find a new job but my parents are about to explode on me, they’re dragging out the argument for days and wanting a explanation but honestly I don’t have one for them. I fear them and I can’t get away from them, my therapist even asked one day if I was safe and I really didn’t know what to tell them, I don’t think my parents would put their hands on me but I know the shit they would put me through (no sleeping endless amounts of house work constant verbal abuse no electronics (which is currently the only thing that gives me a break from the tears and dread and wanting to stop existing, as stupid as it is) but they’d break me psychically and emotionally without even touching me. I fear them so damn much and school and work puts so much weight on top of that. School is stressful as all hell and I don’t even know what I want to do once I graduate in like a month or two. I have no more motivation to do any of the things I wanted to do in life, my main goal since I was a kid was to get away from my parents but they’ve made it clear that that’s not happening. And I’ve even tried cutting my arm once to let it bleed out and they got mad at me for it and saying I was just trying to get out of work so I know they won’t stop if I try to reach out for them to stop. I really don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t just stop school (which they’ve given my parents a court notice cause of unexcused absences which I don’t have so I don’t understand why they’ve given it to them). 

Anyways the point of all this is that I just really don’t know what to do, I’ve lost any motivation I had to keep living which was pushing away the already constant suicidal thoughts. I’m stressed I don’t know what I want to do in life and school is giving me hell. It feels like I’m stuck in a corner and the only way out is to stop existing, but honestly I don’t want to die, I’m scared of the pain and of missing out but what I am I do to?? My shitty life is just going to keep going and I just have no idea how to fix it anymore. I know a lot of it is my fault but I can’t fix my mistakes when I’m too tired to even walk from dealing with my parents and school and a job. 

I wanted to reach out to my grandparents and just stay with them for a bit and hell- I’d even redo my senior year of highschool at this point- but I’m scared of trying to get away from my parents, I’m terrified of what they’ll do once they have their hands on me again.

I am reaching out for help as I am struggling with multiple personal loans from online platforms, with a total outstanding amount of ₹5 lakhs. Until now, I have been managing somehow, but this month, I am unable to cover my overdue payments, which amount to ₹40,000.

I am committed to repaying my debts, but these platforms do not offer any flexibility, and my current financial situation only allows me to pay a small portion from my salary. I am constantly receiving calls from recovery agents, facing immense pressure and threats. I do not want my family to be involved in this situation.

I feel completely overwhelmed and unable to express my struggles to my parents. In the past, my mother sold her gold to help me clear my debts, but I ended up in this cycle again. I do not want to burden her any further.

If anyone can offer guidance or support, I would be extremely grateful.

1jqf598,SuicideWatch,1743677090.0,"I dont even know anymore I have no idea where I can even rant about these feelings, but I just feel so hopeless.



All my life, I’ve had random bouts of sadness that never go away, along with self-hatred and generally low self-esteem, sometimes accompanied by suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to assume that I have anything since I haven’t been diagnosed. But this month has been the absolute worst for me, and it all started from one trigger.



For a little bit of context, I’m a freshman BS Psychology student at National University, and I made the terrible decision to cheat on one of my major subjects—Psychological Statistics. I’ve been an honor student my whole life, and my parents, especially my mother, always compare me to others who do well. That pressure haunts my every action, forcing me to strive for the best, even when it’s destroying me inside.



I cheated—not on the entire test, but on about 10 out of 100 items—because I have an extremely bad habit of overthinking. I accepted the fact that I got caught, took a zero on my finals, and took full responsibility for what I did. I understand that it was wrong. But the most painful part of this whole situation isn’t that I didn’t make it to the Dean’s List—since I barely passed Psych Stats (I got a 1.5, while my other grades were around 3.5 or 4). It’s the fact that my teacher vouched for me. She knew I was a diligent student, that I obviously tried, and that I was a model student in class who just made a bad decision. Because of her, along with the department head, I was only given a zero in the finals rather than being reported for a major academic dishonesty offense. I am very grateful to them.



But what hurts the most is how I got caught. Apparently, someone in my class had told my teacher about it since midterms. I had been cheating that way since midterms, and that’s how I was exposed. The fact that my own classmates did this to me has crushed me. Now, I feel like I don’t deserve anything I’ve ever achieved. I’ve started isolating myself from my friends because I keep thinking—why would they even want to associate with someone as pathetic as me? I can’t even trust my own circle of friends because they had already heard the rumors about my cheating since midterms, but they never told me.



Every time I’m in class, I feel like when they look at me, it’s with disgust, and I just want to cry and disappear. I don’t even know why I stayed in this section. I should’ve just registered in another one, but now, I just go along with my friend group, pretending nothing’s wrong.



I feel so worthless every day because I feel like a burden to everyone. And honestly, it’s true—no one gains anything from me. I’m just some pathetic kid who’s too greedy for achievements.



I feel like I’m going insane. I’ve become so paranoid in class that I don’t even want to participate in recitations anymore because I feel like no one likes me. I’ve always been fragile when it comes to how others perceive me.



I’ve actually been like this since high school, but I managed to develop a bit of self-care in senior high. Then a breakup happened with my ex, and now this happened in my second term of freshman year. And honestly? I just want to die and end it all. I’m such a lazy, useless person. My mom was right—I really am worthless. Haha. Even here, I couldn’t bring myself to post this on my main account because I’m too much of a coward, afraid that my friends and family might find out.

I’ve detoxed before but that was always at a rehab center and I can’t get into one soon enough, I’m gonna have to detox at home I am just struggling with doing so.
I had a big support group however I’ve isolated myself so much to the point now all I have are three individuals in my day to day life my ex boyfriend who uses and sells, my Roomate who’s an addict herself , and a enabler who is in love with me yet pretty much fed up with supplying me with financial support .
My mom asked me to stop lying to her two weeks ago being I kept breaking promises and flaking on her and my step dad when they need my help with my 6 year old niece whom I love the most in the world and completely adores me but sadly I get sick and can’t mange to make it to visit her until I can score drugs to be well which is pathetic , my sister was murdered 4 years ago come this July and my parents thankfully adopted her daughter however it’s so unfair that I can’t be there for her the way I want to be and my parents and sister need me to be due to my addiction.

I don’t work , I made a poor decision getting behind her wheel drunk last Fourth of July and got a dui in Orange County and I live in Northen California now in terrible city with minimal resources for opiate addicts.
I have tried methodone

Sublicate and suboxone 
None of it stuck
I think I gotta go cold turkey .
As long as I get clean I can be surrounded by all the best people I’ve walked away from .

However it’s completely been impossible for me to manage to straighten out , I guess I’m just sharing all this because I need an outlet that’s anonymous somewhat I had a blog filled with experiences and poetry and hope about grief and my addiction and my feelings however I can’t stand myself to post anything on there anymore being it’s supposed to be about my recovery from drugs and being better and living thru the murder of my sister and I have yet to recover from said addiction .
I’m also single pretty much because my last boyfriend who got me into opiates became super mentallynabusive until I snapped and hurt him back physically sadly , I like to believe I’m a genuinely good person .

However my track record and addiction probably proves otherwise .
I am so stuck and really just filled with shame and hope that I can kick this drug and start leading a better life I was a licensed massage therapist living in San Francisco living my best life before I started using meth 7 years ago and than Covid happened and then my sister died and I was diagnosed with a life threatening illlnesss and even moved to seatttle with my brother to be better until I started using fentanyl with a guy and now I’m back in my hometown in not cal completely jaded , semi feeling hopeless, and really sad.
I hope to be better .
I’m open to any suggestion and words of advice .

1jr6wmd,Addiction,1743754894.0,"Need advice on what to do with addict Hi there,

I am using a burner account for obvious reasons but let me portray the situation I am in. My girlfriend is a former Cannabis addict, was in an open clinic around a year ago and was more or less clean for a pretty long time. A few weeks ago she relapsed, probably because of stress from losing her job and having nothing to do in her free time. It also doesn't help that you can just buy that stuff online and let it be sent to the nearest pharmacy where i live but i digress.

So she came out to me, we talked about it and now I don't really know how to act in a situation like that. We made a deal that we smoked one last blunt together, I took her leftovers and stored them away.

But why am I telling you all this? Well, here I need advice: She asked me if we could dose it to one joint a day, when she is alone or something similar. I am not an addiction therapist and I don't have access to one in real life so I thought this sub would be a good starting point.

i haven’t spent money on any drug in like a week, i still get offered things here and there. 2 days ago i had no self control and got high again. not spending money was a first big step for me. i want to be able to say no when i’m offered but when it’s in front of my eyes i just can’t say no.
i was spending ~$500 a month on drugs. yes that might sound like a lot but i really was. i would definitely share sometimes but i basically ingested about $500 worth of drugs monthly with other people also giving me free things, and i would never say no to free drugs. i also have so many friends that trap so i guess i also need to watch who i surround myself with and my influence. i definitely don’t have enough self discipline to quit, but its been 3 years and people have actually told me things like “last time i talked to you, you said you were going sober” and this was not a one time thing. i’ve ranged from 115lbs - 145lbs just this year (2025, yes its literally april and my weight has fluctuated by 30lbs) i wish i was being dramatic with all of these numbers, including my age. (i’m not even I8 yet, i don’t wanna live like this anymore.) i finally understand what people say by throwing your life away with drugs. i never considered myself an addict until i realized it became a daily habit. somebody please help me get out 
of this loophole. i’ve tried practicing christianity to see if getting closer with god would help me get further away from drugs and it honestly has not been working. no hate to any christians out there, it’s just hard to believe anybody except for myself anymore, i feel like i’ve guided myself through my whole life and it’s just hard to believe in what somebody else is saying. i might try practicing buddhism, maybe it’s more of a fit for me since i’ve always been a bit interested in their religion. but i seriously need help, i want to better my life but i need to better myself before i take any further steps.",going sober need tips self discipline havent spent money drug like week still get offered things days ago self control got high spending money first big step want able say im offered front eyes cant say spending month drugs yes might sound like lot really would definitely share sometimes basically ingested worth drugs monthly people also giving free things would never say free drugs also many friends trap guess also need watch surround influence definitely dont enough self discipline quit years people actually told things like last time talked said going sober one time thing ive ranged lbs lbs year yes literally april weight fluctuated lbs wish dramatic numbers including age im even yet dont wanna live like anymore finally understand people say throwing life away drugs never considered addict realized became daily habit somebody please help get loophole ive tried practicing christianity see getting closer god would help get away drugs honestly working hate christians hard believe anybody except anymore feel like ive guided whole life hard believe somebody else saying might try practicing buddhism maybe fit since ive always bit interested religion seriously need help want better life need better take steps,3,2,Positive,Low Concern

I was an opiate addict for years until 3 years ago when I went to rehab and got sober. Wife got out of military after 14 years and we moved. Primary prescribed me Valium and I began trading it for coke, which was never a DOC of mine, but for some reason I really liked it this time. I went on a 4 month bender. Worked because the guy I sold to had Xanax and I would give me some when I was low, so
I never ran out. Well I did 10 days early, because he stopped getting them. 4 days in I'm sick, 5 days in, 4 seizures. Go hospital and I'm honest with the nurse. He was very nice and understanding.

If that isn’t a recipe for disaster i don’t know what is. Just for context my ex was in a drug court program for 3 years so he was sober for years off everything but he graduated about 2 months ago and that’s when  everything took a turn for the worst. Even before he graduated i did let him know that if he ever touched meth or heroin i wouldn’t stick around because he did have a previous meth addiction, it seemed like he took the conversation well at the time and said he had so many things in the future just to throw things away so that gave me a sense of reassurance, looking back i should’ve known better. He knew i did coke and it didn’t bother him despite me telling him that if he needed to keep his distance from me i would understand. He told me it was fine because it didn’t really seem to take a toll on me and honestly it didn’t i mainly used it to have energy for whenever i would work doubled at work. A few weeks after i told him that i started noticing some weird behaviors with him. He had changed into a completely different person, he was up extremely early at all times and would even call me at 5 in the morning while i was still sleeping and he became really distant with me, no longer taking me on dates no longer complimenting me,and was never in the mood to have sex which for him was out of the ordinary since he used to always have a sex drive with me. At first i accused him of cheating but now i know it was just the meth. He lost an insane amount of weight in such a short time as well and that’s how i started piecing everything together. I eventually did find a meth pipe in his car and when i confronted him about it his response was i had no right to talk when i was also a heavy drug user, i tried to tell him that meth was way worse and something way more addicting and more likely to take a toll on your life but he wasn’t hearing it and as much as it hurt i eventually apologized and told him he was right, so we continued dating. A few days after that im asking him if he could get me more coke but his guy only had meth, i told him i didn’t want that and he said i was crazy not to get it because it was the same as the coke just cheaper with longer affects, i was crashing real bad off the coke and had recently been going through a lot with my family so i said what the hell and i tried it.

1jr0j41,Addiction,1743731527.0,"Where’s My Blue? It starts like a joke. A comic. A cartoon. Something that makes you laugh for a second….until it doesn’t.

There’s a version of this story that’s funny. Absurd, even. But beneath the sketch lines and speech bubbles, there’s something else.
There’s the quiet horror of watching someone you love drift so far away they forget your name, forget themselves.
There’s the aluminum foil on the table, the glassy stare, the slow disappearing act that never quite ends but never stops hurting either.

Fentanyl doesn’t take people all at once.
It takes them in pieces.
First their clarity, then their memory, then their warmth.
Then the voice that used to call you baby or check in on you when you hadn’t eaten or remind you that your favorite show was coming on.
Then, sometimes, their body too.

And for the ones left behind, it’s a kind of grief you can’t explain.
You mourn someone who’s still breathing.
You pray for miracles in silence.
You beg the universe not for healing, but just… presence. One more laugh. One moment where they look at you and you know they’re really there.

If you’ve already lost someone to this—whether to the drug itself or to the slow, living absence it creates…

you are not alone.
And your pain is not invisible.

Sometimes, it takes a silly cartoon to hold up a mirror to the kind of heartbreak most people don’t talk about.

If you know, you know.
And if you don’t….hold tight to the ones you love.

she wants me to promise that im going to be okay and never use again but i dont know how to do that. she wants me to tell her on the days im struggling but then wants me to console her anxiety about it when i talk to her.

So, I’ve been struggling to quit vaping, and no amount of logical reasoning about its harm seems to be enough to make me stop. 

No matter how much I tell myself it’s bad for my health, I just keep going back.

Now, I’ve come up with a strange but potentially effective mental trick: I’m essentially “promising” myself that if I stay off vaping for a month or two, I’ll reward myself with a line of cocaine or meth. (Just to be clear, I’ve never actually used either of those drugs before, nor do I intend to. This is purely a mind trick.)

The idea is that my brain, for whatever reason, finds it easier to commit when there’s some extreme “reward” at the end—even if it’s something I would never actually go through with.

This month is probably the best because the cravings are vague and very manageble and I found a lot of other things to do: studies, work and hobbies. But there're still loads of work to do: I'm at the point now where I became addicted in the first place. When you get sober for a long period of time you start to see things more clearly. For me weed wasn't a cause but rather a very logical outcome: I was very self-concious, depressed and anxious all the time and used to turn to other things to shut off my mind: online games, porn and, eventually, weed (which worked the best in combination with other stuff). All those things would only worsen the problem that had to be paid attention to and to be fixed. And now, since I minimized all these things, there's fertile soil to actually become stronger. I was amazed how meditation helped with my case: all the emotions I have, I wouldn't feel them or pay attention to them, but they were still there and ruled my life. Now I've been training myself to actually feel, classify and localize a particular emotion and then proccess it rather than dull it, which had a huge impact on the social aspect on my life and the overall wellbeing. I don't think it's possible for me to just quit weed or any other addiction and have the same life I used to have, there gotta be a complete change (gradual, but change). It's also funny to observe your brain doing tricks to persuade you to downgrade your life back where it was, a life that it's got so used to. A thought about change is intimidating to it. Your brain will say: ""See, it's been 3 months, you wasn't addicted afterall as you managed to stay off dope for that long"" or ""Well, now you've changed and there's absolutely no way that you'll return to the point of getting high every single day, you're smarter than that, so you'll smoke moderately"". Once you start paying attention to the direction of your thoughts rather than their content, it gets much easier every single day.

1jqem8u,Addiction,1743675117.0,"10 days: no alco, coke, cigarettes - the super fast end of addiction? (With a LOONG preparation for it) Dear all,

I am super glad to have this feeling of maybe being free for good? On the 10th day, after semi-developed addiction (but still an addiction), I have caught myself for the past 3-4 days, that I feel actually \*better\* than on coke or on alcohol: in the intensity and the duration of my state. I.e., this renders coke, alcohol, cigs useless, then? 

I am super glad, and I think the universe sort of aligns with this feeling by having only the sunny days for these same days.

I mean, for me the hardest was the 3-4-5 days, I think, when I felt this loss of control over the addiction: i.e., I want to get drunk now, and I start having this pleasant anticipation of a pleasure, so I was almost to go for it. However, I had to lie, to reflect, to cry out, to pray, that this was rather tragic, actually: am I not the one in control? Am I to be forever under this demon and fight these urges forever? I cried and cried. So, I even woke up during the night, feeling ""fuck, I need a rest from this urging me all the time during the day"", like some sort of entity tried to manipulate me into promising to give it a rest. THen during the day, I had anger about work's colleauges (who were ""stupid fuckers"") and sadness (""because my wife left, not only cuz of addiction, but of this also, but it's difficult and I am not SO much concerned, but still kind of am, especially when we were doing alco, drugs together""). So, then I just had this ""fuck, I want it"".

And, maybe that's the core part: I was doing psychotherapy with a very good coach/psychologist/spiritual guide, who had me meditate on the feeling of an urge (a day before the above urge). So, I found out that the urge simply disappeared once I have accepted myself? Like, the desire for drunkenness (from anything, really) is just a response to avoiding the pain of not accepting myself. No matter the reason why, but it was quite bizzarre.

And then, after a few days, of walking, without drinking, I was also getting emotional that I was basically anesthizing myself (funnily enough, coke also is like dental anaesthetic, so I found this sort of symbolic), and thus avoiding life, and not actually living and experiencing it? The joy that is much greater? I even got into this surreal, psychedelic like state (w/o drugs) that ok, I actually experienced a \*different\* perception, that is sober, but still different and interesting, as it's not the same old ""get drunk"".

And as a result, I was just feeling like these goose bumps for 1-2 hours, which I have at max for 5 mins on coke. Also, by focusing my thoughts in the direction of ""I resolved this shit, so what much else can I resolve?"", I intensified this sort of euphoric state of achievement.

Moreover, without alcohol and drugs, I had my orgasms much stronger, like it's a sort of energy flowing through me, and also without the porn.

And ok, fair enough, I am still eating chips, but - it's maybe only temporary crutch, and still much better. I ate them anyway with the drugs.

So, in the end, the main question: ""what would them drugs gimme anyway?"" is to be answered by ""a temporary, though guaranteed switch in the state that is worse than I could have organized myself with the consequent depression and further cravings in the future, resulting in the loss of control"". I think, this is a checkmate idea.

And ok, I may sound arrogant here, and I also recognize that saying ""I solved this"" and then bam, a relapse or something, but even then I had preparations that even if the case, even then, I would \*know\* that it's 10 days I didn't do this. And so, like a strategist, I am setting up all these ideas, all these self-reinforcements in all the ways that could potentially have me dragged into the useless shit, based primarily only on this minor subconscious demon that maybe doesn't even want to be inside me.

For instance, I resolved the urges like that: since, I have all these stupid ideas, like ""why don't I grab the wheel of a taxi driver and drive us into the pithole to die or cripple ourselves?"", of which at first I was sort of ashamed, like am I crazy? But then I understood that some have these, and I don't act on it, and so why bother? Then the urges are of the same class: they are not something special, but rather also just stupid ideas that have no basis, on which I can decide not to act. Easy. 

Also, since I finally had the subjective reinforcing experience of feeling good without drugs (well, ok, I still drank coffee, but it's not comparable): then the urges are also easily resolved by referring to the experience of sitting in the sauna on the countdown, on running 10km marathon, on going through the gym sets, or sitting for 6h on a tattoo session, about 10 sessions within 2 weeks and accepting the pain, sort of. All these also cover the flanks, sort to say, like the military units.

And so, in the end, I just wanted to share the experience, and I am still getting used to the good, as my coach told me, when I shared the experiences of feeling unusually well without shit, and being interested and engaged.

In the end, all the hormones: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, noradrenalin, adrenalin, etc. - they are all within me. So, this means that I am the one who can trigger these states, and it's sort of stupid to lose the ability to an external substance. This is the core of not wanting an addiction -> it's like selling a soul to the devil for him to give you your desire, when in fact, your soul IS the thing that can grant you that desire and infinite number of other desires. Selling a debit card with infinite money for a million dollars. Same logic everywhere.

Though, of course, it took me WAY long story of going through psychotherapists (maybe, 10 years, in fact) and during this time the addiction raised or subsided. Like dropping cigs, amphetamines, weed, but keeping alco. And fair enough, judging on what I uncovered in psychotherapy: my mother when dying of cancer blamed me for her death when being in this sort of semi-aware state; a divorce, and everything else, which I have just accepted as a part of my history. Again, I decided to convert the suffering into profits: for instance, now, I can rely on the experience of dropping the addiction process in my future projects. By doing it alone, without the use of psychiatry or rehabs, I am not going to win even a billion of dollars, figuratively speaking, I am going to win the whole world of experience for myself. Namely, working AND feeling good about it. Fucking AND having intense orgasms about it. Speaking to people AND not feeling anxious and being super aware of my and their's psychology and maybe using it to help them, create efficient business processes, make money, travel the world, eat great food. Working and studying AND feeling very aware.

Speaking of the latter, as I dropped it all, I started feeling higher awareness. Like, I am smart myself. But if it's all been covered by the brain fog of drunkenness, then hell am I going to be much more quick. Like, I was just smiling for being very aware of the French exercise that I was learning. This state of feeling good makes me feel even better all by itself: like, I just smile at that I smile at the world without any chemical intervention.

So, it's like this for now. Maybe, this could help someone. After all, addiction is a sort of life's challenge. Tackling addiction is a sort of a game: how can you outplay and outmaneuver a subpersonality of yours before it will chase you to a grave. Maybe, addiction can be appreciated for all the challenges that it teaches you to overcome. Doesn't mean that you need to partake in it, but once you have it, then maybe learn from it. I have a nice principle from childhood stories that you should strive to convert foes to friends, as it would mean that the next foes you face would be even more likely to convert to friends, since you have your older foes at your side already, and so it's a snowball rolling.",days alco coke cigarettes super fast end addiction loong preparation dear super glad feeling maybe free good th day

1jqds29,Addiction,1743671850.0,"Relapsed for 10 days. At first, it felt easy. Effortless. No guilt, no shame—just comfort. Like nothing mattered.
“It’s fine, I’ll start a new streak soon.”
“One more video won’t ruin the next recovery phase.”
Lies we tell ourselves when the dopamine is high and the mind is numb.

But now, the numbing has worn off.

And here I am—lying in bed with a foggy brain and a heavy heart.
The dopamine is drained. My mind hurts.
I feel like a hollow shell of myself. No energy, no willpower, no emotion—just dread.
The weight of regret settles in. You try to distract yourself, try to move on, but nothing works. Nothing feels good anymore.

And worst of all?
That voice creeps in:
“Was it worth it?”
You thought you were down before the relapse?
Compare it to this—this darkness, this pit you’re in now.

This post is a note to my future self. A reminder of what the last three days have felt like.
The emotional chaos, the depression, the guilt, the sleepless nights.
Because when the next urge comes, it’ll try to sell me another lie—that it’s worth a few seconds of pleasure.

It’s not.

This is my proof. My evidence. My blueprint to remember the price I pay every time.

Stay strong. One day at a time.

I know it’s not that long but we’ve been together like everyday. In beginning of relationship I’ve noticed signs overly tired, not as in the mood sexually, nodding, dozing and taking awhile in car. Constant fatigue and napped a lot or slept late. He is a smoker weed and cigs so I thought maybe he was rolling up etc just chilling. He would usually come to me a few hours after coming home from work. But I’d have to call him a lot because he’d fall asleep a lot when he got home. On multiple occasions I’ve found foil, burnt foil specifically and he would leave marks on my door I’d see it on his head and hands from touching his face he would be covered in black debris. He always admitted to no problem. I’ve found him nodded out in car with foil straws and substances. Multiple occasions Id get in the car when he’s nodded out and has no idea I’m there and question him and tell him to tell me the truth I won’t judge. I know he needs help but I can’t help him if he doesn’t own up to him having a problem. This has happened maybe 3/4 times I’ve caught him always blames thca. I was dumb and did my research and people do smoke thca on foil so I gave him the benefit of the doubt but researching symptoms lead me to believe it was an opioid. He’s struggled in the past with Xanax and perks and got clean. But he’s beaten every at home drug test. Because of the signs I saw in him I suspected fent. But wasn’t sure. He’s pretty functioning besides the extreme fatigue and nodd. He’s a great partner super nice sweet thoughtful. Recently we fought again because I found him nodded in car. Then I said I can’t be with you because you lie and lie and lie and I don’t deserve that I know I deserve more. But I can’t help but feel like I’m abandoning him because I feel he needs help. A few days go by I was supposed to see him and then I called and he answered crying saying he needs help. His mom caught him with foil and straw and substance. But he claims he flushed it. We had kinda an intervention with some family and me and we agreeded he needed to detox and he needed to tell us the truth. He blamed it on perks and he flushed everything bag and all. Something told me check the pants when I went in his room. And I found bundles or shit tied up in rubbber bands I went to his mom and confronted her and he came in all upset trying to snatch shit from me I blocked the door and took it back she dumped it on the bed and said what is this. I said it’s not perks I’m not dumb and he admitted it to be fent. Knowing that it’s fent, I’m terrified I don’t want him to die on me. I’m scared my anxiety depression and mind is racing all the time I feel like a detective on here trying to find out what shit could be and how he’ll withdrawal. He went cold turkey but he said he’s been weening himself and he didn’t want to but agreed. He didn’t even give it 24 hours and I found him in the bathroom with foil and straw I broke down it breaks my soul. I’m so scared for him I don’t want him to die. All he wants is to ween of fent himself but how will I know how much he takes. I can’t monitor that. I do believe he wants to stop I don’t think he wants to be dependent I do believe that. I think it has him in a chokehold because of the withdrawal symptoms and he’s scared to go through them. He went through them for like 3/4 hours and he said he wanted to die he can’t take it , he can’t do it, and he needs to ween himself off. I also told him it’s a mental thing he needs to talk himself into it that he could do it and he is strong and he’s not gonna die and he will come out stronger.  I know in my heart he doesn’t wanna be this way. I do believe people could change. He has an option to withdrawal and take tramadol (controlled tho ) to try and help symptoms but idk how effective that would be. What am I supposed to do? Stay and support him and hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel? Do people ween off of fent alone and have the will power to not do more ? Is he a compulsive liar and will I ever trust him? He’s broken to many promises and I’ve caught him with stuff to many times. I feel addicted to trying to understand his addiction.

For hours I was trying to fight back the thoughts of drinking. This morning after another night of drinking way more than I should’ve and regretting it the next morning I’ve spent the morning grappling with the fact that I can’t ignore I’m falling into addiction with alcohol. I have a family history of alcoholism on both sides, with my father being an alcoholic. My oldest sister is an alcoholic (she’s since recovered). My mom doesn’t really drink, she’s never enjoyed substances (including just prescription medications) because she doesn’t like not feeling like herself and out of control.)But growing up my mom always informed me of the dangers of drinking. I grew up thinking it was wild that people drank and used drugs underage and was judgmental towards those who did it, because I’d think why would you do something that’s documented so heavily to cause addiction and ultimately harm your life? Then I hit the age of 17, moved for like the billionth time in my life and ended up at a high school where drinking and smoking weed and vaping was very common. Not saying it was like everyone who went to that school but it was normalized for sure. I first get hooked on vaping. I hate my nicotine addiction so so bad and despise the person who first offered it to me, and despise myself even more for taking that first hit. Within a few days I was buying my own vapes. Then I don’t know the exact timeline but another friend also offered me a hit of their wax pen, the euphoria I felt was unmatched, I eventually started smoking everyday. There was even a short period of time I smoked at school, tho I quickly stopped that and just smoked after school and at work. I drank for the first time around that time too, tho at the time I didn’t really enjoy the feeling and felt too out of control and just preferred weed. So it wasn’t something that was a problem at the time. Fast forward, as time goes one I’m smoking everyday and basically high all day minus a few hours overall. I love it, I felt like I was free for the first time in my life, it brought me so much joy and I was young and dumb and believed, weed isn’t addictive so I’m good. But I’d always get so defensive when I’d see people online discussing the fact that weed is in fact addictive. I stopped smoking for about two years when I was pregnant and breastfeeding and being sober for that long I’ve realized how crazy it was that I thought that was normal. But while I was breastfeeding while I missed smoking weed, I wasn’t comfortable with smoking again until I was done breastfeeding. So I drink. It starts out with just one drink a night after I’ve finished cleaning up and have a little time to eat dinner and unwind, this is after my child is a few months old so she wasn’t waking up as frequently most days. Some nights I was experiencing what I now understand was postpartum depression, and same with when I was smoking all the time, if I was feeling particularly heavy emotionally, I didn’t drink so despite knowing of alcoholism runs in my family, I thought to myself this is proof the “addiction genes” skipped me. Because deep down I was so scared of it becoming a problem. Months and months of this, it turned into two drinks a night (sneaking the second drink). Then it became drinking as soon as my baby went to bed. And doing chores while drunk. But I still convinced myself it wasn’t a problem. Then it turned into having one drink during the day. Then finishing off the drink in the morning I didn’t finish be night before, having another drink in the afternoon, and having several drinks at night. A couple months of this and I’m grappling with addiction. I don’t want to accept I have a problem, I want to believe that I can stop and only do it socially. Or that when I’m working full time again (I’m currently a SAHM) that it’ll change, bc the days I work, I love my job so much and don’t think about drinking at all, and when I get home, I don’t really feel like drinking (still Ill have one or two tho). I haven’t been needed at work for like a month now (it’s a on call type of job) so my drinking has just gotten worse. I feel like a terrible person and mother. My boyfriend is so kind and gentle with me and expresses his worry, but he doesn’t know that I’ve drink occasionally during the day. When he’s off of work he knows that I like to drink before we go out. I justified it saying I just miss smoking weed, but now that I’ve added weed back into the equation and am in the early stages of smoking again, it feels worse than drinking. So I only do it at night and take like one hit small hit, sometimes two. So instead of smoking weed I’m drinking before going to go grocery shopping or going out to eat (where I make sure we go somewhere that serves alcohol so I can drink more). I’ve been trying to convince myself once I’ve gotten acclimated back into smoking weed I’ll drop the drinking. But it’s not true. I’m addicted. It hasn’t even been a year of my drinking daily and I’m already an alcoholic. I used to think to myself my mom’s concern with me drinking was her cursing me. That I was above what’s written in my DNA. I have a problem that I can’t control. It’s gotten to the point that some days after a night of really heavy drinking I have shakes. So I drink during the day to subside it. Tonight when my boyfriend gets home from work I’m going to admit that yes I do have a problem and I let my ego get in that way of seeing and accepting it. I think my love for substances comes from my struggle with intrusive thoughts. I’m looking for a therapist because I know I need professional help. I want to do better for my family and myself.

I constantly hear my neighbours talking about taking me to court for a restitution for property damage to furniture and the air conditioning system and it’s going to cost upwards of 200,000 and that I will likely get out on mental health grounds because of my bipolar.

They are apparently testing the waste water because our pipes are connected so whenever I urinate or number two they test it and see if the readings gone up or down. 

Apparently I caused someone to have a failed pregnancy because the chemicals somehow went through the air conditioning system which is supposedly connected centrally for everyone in the apartment system and I also broke the aircon somehow as well which will be in the court case.

They are testing samples on my rubbish like drink bottles etc and are following and tracking me everywhere and commenting about my life.

The scary part is they’re saying things I never thought of before or words that I don’t typically use. Apparenty I will be summoned to court on Friday.

Ive managed to kick all of my drug and alcohol related addictions. Ketamine, coke, meth, tequila, oxy - anything I could get my hands on. Then I hit a relatively low patch and got into something I had never really experienced. Extreme binging and making myself throw up. This is HELL. This is the WORST addiction I have had to deal with and it's ruining my body and my brain, bank and life. 

I was doing REALLY good and was even in probably the best place I've been in in years last month. But a bad heart break threw me off completely.

I'm talking spending 2000 in a week on food to eat and throw up. It's been a month. I called out of work for a week because I was so desperate to stop the cycle but I have to go back in tomorrow and I'm panicking.

I cannot undo all my hard work. I have no money for therapy. I feel good ugly to go outside. I can hardly shower. I know if I keep going I'm going to lose my mind and harm myself. I don't really have any support or friends. I don't know what to do and I'm slip slip sliding 

I'm so desperate to stop that I've been genuinely thinking of getting coke or Adderall so I don't eat... How pathetic.

I haven't struggled with this in months and months and I'm terrified. I worked so hard to look and feel good. I know if I get back on it I'll be back where I was in a month or two which is okay.

But I can't go back to the gym if I hate how I look. I can't leave my house or shower or function AT ALL. IM TERRIFIED BECAUSE IVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
can anyone please help. I don't know what to do.

I am so so bloated and just depressed. I throw up so much that, and this is really gross and embarrassing I feel so much shame. But I piss myself. And I'll just keep going. I am in a hellish cycle only I can pull myself out of but I'm really really really having a rough time this time. I'm just watching myself undo all my love and care and hard work.

Please if someone can help with a plan or maybe be an accountability buddy or something. Please I am a good person, I am desperate and I want all addiction out of my life I cannot live addicted to food now. I can go my whole life without cocaine but I can't avoid food forever.

It all started while I was in the Army. I attempted to end my life two times with no knowledge of why just the how. I have been put in the mental institution twice. I have tried to overcome my medical problems and to no avail. I have a constant need to use alcohol and cocaine. I should say I have a nicotine vape as well. Usually I have my episodes while on alcohol, I go through 3 phases. One of deep sadness, then extreme excitement and happiness, then anger and hate for everything. At the end of my episodes I feel miserable and want to end it all but I don’t. I feel like a coward for wanting to do that & put a burden on my family. 

Whenever I drink I am always home and don’t drink alone. I have done rehab & actively have a psychiatrist as well and therapist. In the end it always comes back to me drinking in secret & I’ll admit it isn’t a lot but it’s still a drink while in rehab. I’ve expressed my concerns to my facility and I have been able to maintain a period of abstinence but I always fall.

1jpadf9,Addiction,1743550624.0,"The chat that made me RETHINK success I had an interesting conversation the other day that's been stuck in my head ever since.

I was catching up with an old friend, who we'll refer to as James.

He's what most would consider wildly successful -- he's built and exited a massively successful company and is building another currently, has a beautiful home, the picturesque family.

Yet as we talked, I noticed his energy was low and his eyes looked tired.

And for better or worse, I don't shy away from the bigger questions.

So when I asked how things were really going, he paused for a moment.

Then, he finally said:

""I've achieved everything I set out to do... but some days I can barely drag myself out of bed.""

Despite his external results and the fact his life looked kinda ideal from the outside, it wasn't. He's been feeling increasingly disconnected from his wife over the years, and hasn't spent nearly as much time with his kids as he'd like over these years where he's been running on caffeine and stress.

And when I asked him what he does to cope with his stress, after a little digging past the surface-level responses, he revealed that he'd been using porn and alcohol as his primary ""stress relief"" for years.

In his words: ""I'm successful at everything except actually living.""

He *wanted* to be having more intimacy with his wife, spending more time with his kids, creating memories... but the reality of the situation has been really missing the mark.

This hit me hard because I've been there. Different circumstances, same fundamental issue.

Looking successful on paper while feeling empty inside.

Achieving goals that were nice, but didn't actually fulfill some of my deeper needs and desires.

And using escapism to dodge confronting that uncomfortable truth.

When I shared some of what helped me turn things around, he asked pointed questions. Dude actually listened super intently and even took a few notes.

This guy who's paid six figures to give advice was humble enough to recognize that something was off and he needed a different approach.

Three things became clear to me as we chatted:

1. External success without internal alignment is a hollow victory.
2. Even the most ""successful"" among us struggle with the same fundamental challenges. Status and wealth don't make you immune to disconnection, emptiness, or addiction.
3. A man who isn't fulfilled with and satisfied by how he's living isn't truly successful, at least not by my standards, regardless of how much he earns. There's more to life, and if our relationships, lifestyle, etc are out of whack then there's still a lot of work to be done.

It was a cool conversation.

Solid insights, and he's decided he's taking some major steps toward repairing things. Not by abandoning his career or achievements, but by reconnecting with what actually matters to him beyond wealth accumulation -- starting with his wife, and cutting down on that porn habit to help make those sparks fly again.

For men caught in similar patterns, this is often where real transformation begins.

Not necessarily with grand gestures, but with honest reflection and a willingness to change.

What areas of your life look successful on paper but feel empty in reality? And what might change if you redirected some of your energy toward creating a greater level of fulfillment?

Something worth considering.",chat made rethink success interesting conversation day thats stuck head ever since catching old friend well refer james hes would consider wildly successful hes built exited massively successful company building another currently beautiful home picturesque family yet talked noticed energy low eyes looked tired better worse dont shy away bigger questions asked things really going paused moment finally said ive achieved everything set days barely drag bed despite external results fact life looked kinda ideal outside wasnt hes feeling increasingly disconnected wife years hasnt spent nearly much time kids hed like years hes running caffeine stress asked cope stress little digging past surfacelevel responses revealed hed using porn alcohol primary stress relief years words im successful everything except actually living wanted intimacy wife spending time kids creating memories reality situation really missing mark hit hard ive different circumstances fundamental issue looking successful paper feeling empty inside achieving goals nice didnt actually fulfill deeper needs desires using escapism dodge confronting uncomfortable truth shared helped turn things around asked pointed questions dude actually listened super intently even took notes guy whos paid six figures give advice humble enough recognize something needed different approach three things became clear chatted external success without internal alignment hollow victory even successful among us struggle fundamental challenges status wealth dont make immune disconnection emptiness addiction man isnt fulfilled satisfied hes living isnt truly successful least standards regardless much earns theres life relationships lifestyle etc whack theres still lot work done cool conversation solid insights hes decided hes taking major steps toward repairing things abandoning career achievements reconnecting actually matters beyond wealth accumulation starting wife cutting porn habit help make sparks fly men caught similar patterns often real transformation begins necessarily grand gestures honest reflection willingness change areas life look successful paper feel empty reality might change redirected energy toward creating greater level fulfillment something worth considering,2,6,Positive,Low Concern
1jp9ngm,Addiction,1743548682.0,"I disappeared entirely from my old life and relapsed after 6 months of sobriety I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame after all the hard work I put into rebuilding my life.

I relapsed after six months of sobriety.

The weight gain from recovery, buried emotions, emotional numbness (PAWS/anhedonia), and the stress of dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic (non-drug-related) arrest all pushed me in this direction.

And yet, I’m proud of the moves I made these past six months. Every decision was guided by professionals and outside intervention.

I moved across the country after rehab, cut off countless people (actually, everyone), and completely disappeared from my old life.

But now, I feel like I’ve just gotten better at hiding my addiction. I’m not proud of that, but I also don’t want to go back to how things were.

I went from being homeless—living in a trap house—to being graciously reintegrated into my old professional job.

Then, I had a short but intense relapse.

I’m sober again now, but I’m horrified with myself.

So much bad sh*t happened in a row. I’m struggling to process how awful it got.

It feels like I was dealt a terrible hand. And then I made some really bad decisions that led to total life collapse… and addiction.

I took accountability for my role in all of it, rebounded from the impossible, and yet—here we are again.

The thing is, I like my life right now.

But I’m so confused with myself.

I have everything going for me. And I feel ashamed.

I feel very alone.

1jp4xns,Addiction,1743536916.0,"Lost my dad last year to addiction. Last May I had the unfortunate and upsetting news that my dad had died. The initial response was just total shock like it didn’t even feel real what I was being told. My dad’s side reframed a fair amount of the information regarding his death as they felt it would be too much for me, I managed to get the full story and found out that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and fell into a fishing lake and drowned in the middle of the night and his body wasn’t discovered till the next following morning which I believe was Thursday morning when his body was discovered. 

Now before Dad’s death I was brought up with a lot of drugs around me. When I was a teenager I had zero tolerance with drugs would never touch them or consider doing them. As I was enjoying my school activities and hobbies outside of school. I also understood the detrimental effects it has on that person and the people around them. Then when I went to college/uni I started experimenting a bit as most people do at that age and I found it really fun made me confident, made me forget the things in my life that was causing me stress, anxiety, it almost was like a type of medicine but only gives you a short term fix on the problem. FYI I am referring to the Class A drug Cocaine. 

Moving into the start of my adult years and cocaine is still something I’ve done on numerous occasions it starts off just once a month for big social event or celebration of some kind. Then before you know it that once a month has now jumped two times a month, then I start to think about it when i go to my local pub on a random Wednesday then all of sudden I’m fancying a bag. The crazy thing is why would I give into these impulses as I’ve literally seen what it did to my dad and the end result for him. But I still go ahead and do it. I’m aware of all the warning signs I know when it becomes a problem when you’re relying on substance I learnt that the hard way by having to look after an alcoholic all through my child hood. But I still decide to do it myself as well even tho I know full well how bad it can get. 

Since my dad’s death my intake of cocaine has gone up. It’s no longer for social events it’s just me on my own taking it just because i want it. Or I will finish work on a random Tuesday and I will already have it in my head that I am going to get a G when I go home. It’s not even social any more it’s just me isolating myself and doing coke on my own. Now I don’t know why the intake has gone up so much and maybe it is the grief of my dad’s death and I didn’t even notice I was taken more cocaine, maybe it’s a coping mechanism. But it’s gotten to a point now where i am starting to get worried as I feel like the codependency and the need for it is strong and I really don’t want to go down the same rabbit hole my dad went down, cause at the end of the day it’s death. 

Who ever got this far thank you for reading this. This is my first ever time putting something up on Reddit and of course It had to be something like this. I’m not really sure how this works if people can comment or help in any way but I just wanted to write it all out basically. 

Thank you.

Started even doing it in toilets at work and getting minis on my way there. Feel like my childhood trauma + falling in with friends who did drugs very early in life (about 13 yrs old) has made me the way I am and idk what to do. I don’t want to ruin this for myself because this job is an incredible opportunity that I have been working to get for years but I’m worried my using is going to fuck it up for me. I still deliver my work, get everything done on time, meet expectations etc. but I’m worried that one day they might realise I’m slurring in our online calls or I may get caught.

Tried CBT but basically got told I’m too fucked up for it and need to address my issues through counselling first which I’m starting next week. I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have always felt like there are way deeper issues which I have (likely due to growing up around alcoholics, multiple close family suicides/attempts, witnessing parents physical and mental abuse as well as sometimes being the victim of it, seeing parents get arrested, restraining orders etc.) and it is very hard to get a diagnosis in Scotland. I have worked so hard through my struggles to get educated with pretty much 0 support, and now that I am on my way up it’s like all this shit has hit me. I have always dabbled in drugs but never to this point, and I have been going on the way I am for a few months now. Likely it got caused by my dad’s relapse about a year ago that really triggered those childhood feelings.

1jonajd,Addiction,1743481917.0,"Seeking advice for parents I’m reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for advice for my elderly parents ( Father: 64 age and Mother: 60 age, living in India) who are going through a very painful time at home. My father is doing business and my mother is housewife.

My brother has been struggling with addiction (codeine syrup and sleeping pills) for years. Despite two -three rehab attempts, he keeps relapsing. We’re now planning to send him for long-term rehab (1–2 years), hoping this will help him recover. Also he has diabetes.

What makes things even harder is my brother’s wife. She regularly speaks disrespectfully to my parents, uses hurtful language, and shows no willingness to live peacefully. And yet, my parents have always treated her with kindness and respect. She lives Mon-Fri here and sat- Sun her parents house. My parents have even told her that if she feels unhappy in this life, she is free to make her own decisions—even to consider a second marriage if it would bring her peace and a better future for herself and the child or also stay here peacefully, but she doesn’t take any decisions maybe because of society shame. Even after speaking with her family, there’s been no improvement, as they too fear societal judgment.

Though both he and his wife work, they don’t contribute to household expenses. My parents are homeowner and, despite age and health, still covers all the costs. My mother takes care of their child full-time.

We’ve thought about legal steps, but we’re held back by community gossip and inexperience with such matters. We’re a simple family, and we’ve never faced anything like this before. Right now, our main concern is the emotional health of our parents, also her.

If anyone has faced a similar situation or can offer guidance—especially on how to emotionally and practically support elderly parents—we would truly appreciate your insight. We’re also open to hearing any legal advice that could help protect our parents’ rights and bring peace to the home, while handling things as respectfully as possible.

1jowwqq,Addiction,1743517602.0,"Does anyone else feel like they just chase stimulation for no reason at all? Like normal life just isn’t enough? Were you able to find peace in sobriety? I recently started on Vyvanse for ADHD. The Vyvanse was amazing - too amazing. As soon as I was prescribed I was playing with my dose, and while I was productive at first very few quickly I was taking it and just gaming and doomscrolling all day. 

After two months of always craving more despite trying varying doses I told my psychiatrist that it was making me crave more and feel like a junkie + seemed to be making my ADHD worse. 

We decided to try methylphenidate which I’ve been on for the past week and while I have never exceeded dosage guidelines, I have been increasing the dose fairly quickly and finding I only ‘feel good’ for maybe 2 hours and once again want more, like it’s ’never enough’. Methylphenidate in particular just makes me extremely anxious at higher doses so it’s clearly not for me. I’m going to have to tell her this isn’t working either and try non-stimulant options. 

I just feel pretty defeated. I’ve struggled with ADHD my whole life and only got diagnosed recently at 31. I also have an addictive personality and the flavour of my addiction changes like the seasons. It moves between gaming, to eating, to porn, to binge drinking (although just socially), to shopping, to nicotine, and recently it’s felt like I’ve been flirting a dangerous line with stimulants. I hoped that getting medicated would fix my struggles with addiction, not make them worse. 

When I read of other people’s struggles with addiction 90% of the time either they just need to beat the physical dependence and they’re good, or there’s an underlying trauma or mental health issue which once they ‘solve’ they stop struggling. But for me it’s just like I get addicted to anything that makes me feel good, and there never seems to be a point where I feel content with ‘just a bit’ of something good. Moderation of anything feels impossible and I was hoping medicating my ADHD would fix that. 

Does anyone else here struggle with this? Were you able to find peace? I’ve gone through months where I kick all my bad habits and exercise, meditate, and eat well, and I feel good but it’s like I have to be laser focused on good habits or it all just goes to shit.

i have a close family member that smokes.

i know the best thing is to simply be there for them.

but that's f-ing hard to do.

i tell myself, its not my job to figure their life out

i realise it comes from a deep part of me, a part that wants to be seen as helping people.

a part that believes self-worth is tied to the action of 'saving'

and if i dont 'save' then i am unworthy.

i have since worked a lot on this part. it doesn't control me, but i still feel it. i still hear it.

and yes, sometimes it does get the better of me, and i offer advice when i should not.

i think being aware of this helps, and so i wanted to share with you guys.

and even that in itself can be seen as me wanting to 'save' someone out there...

maybe i should have posted this in r/DeepThoughts instead!

\*Edit: To give some status as to the who, what, and why. I can't quit bc it makes all the pain from watching my wife's final moments, the memory is forever burned into my brain. She was my everything, and it was the worst night of my life forever. It makes me forget why I don't have my own house anymore, why I've been stuck at my parents for almost a year, why I didn't work for months or leave my house, until I got a job at my local vape shop one day when I was feeling better and had no success at landing any job. I was a former video editor and have worked for a few major companies. But it takes all I have to just pull my pants on and go to work, it does make me feel better and I love the job bc I'm injured from a car accident and currently getting medical help through a law firm, one of the reasons why I can't quit, super flexible and permanent hours with a super understanding boss, that's really hard to find nowadays. It sucks that I have users coming in to buy meth bowls or talking about hot railing if we don't, just them being there reminds me of how the rush feels. I started as an excuse that since I have ADHD and Adderall is not a potent but in the same family, so I would just use less and I would eat it or snort it to get that ADHD medication effect, that I've learned is a lie and always will be. Idk if Adderall really works with someone that has ADHD as severe as me it makes me focus and all that but not on stuff I need to, gives me energy, I have plenty of that, Klonopin slows my mind down, allows me to think and not talk over people, I do that on and off of ADHD meds or I'm a zombie that doesn't eat or socialize. Kinda how I felt as a kid when I was diagnosed with it and ASD-1. Just to be flat out here, I fucking hate my life, I hate everything, and none of it was my fault, I would have my house back and my wonderful wife, this took everything from me it destroyed me seeing her in her own creation, one second she was my wife now she's gone, it was like a fuck you to the world and me. She left her problems here when she did, and made 1000 more for everyone else, especially me, to escape that's why.

What do I feel like now? I can't stop scratching my beard and face, I have to stop myself from chewing on my lip and grinding my teeth. Sleep would be out the question without my Ambien (which I took about 20 min ago, current time 4:54am). Appetite, still almost non-existent I'm still forcing myself to eat and drink. I get in my car or room, basically anywhere I've used and I immediately take my phone out and turn on the flashlight and I gotta stop myself bc I'm looking for shards that aren't there. I feel like I wanna just rail a line or smoke a bowl to make these feelings stop. But I don't wanna chase the dragon anymore. I might be able to hide my habit now, but dependency is defiantly forming in some way.

Current age 33 I feel the slippery slope of addiction and relapse. To start off I'll begin with the first time I did meth wasn't intentional age 20, idk if my friend knew or didn't all I know is he called me told me he had some girl and if I wanna bang out some gators, hell yeah its Friday. He gets there and we always were smart and would use a bump tool to test it, see how good it was, or if it was actually coke, he said ""house rules, the host gets the first bump"", at the time someone I felt as being a close friend this wasn't ominous foreshadowing, if he knew, well I could tell 100% the instant that powder hit my nose that was not coke, then nearly immediately I felt like I was going lightspeed and I could do anything, I also knew that it was meth the way it burned was like molten dragon piss in powder form or something. I guess being the ""good"" friend, I say it with quotes bc he became an addict immediately after so I'm not sure, he was he said something like ""fuck dude, I guess Imma ride it with ya"" Then it was 2 days of gacked the fuck out, I hated it bc all I could do after he left for the next 8 hours was lay in bed and try to jerk off with zero result(clarity I doubt it was 8 hours, but it was long enough I'll say that). I guess you're all wondering how'd he not know by looking at it that it wasn't coke, well it was 100% shake-and-bake all white powder and not enough light for me to really tell, I know bc at the time and a few years prior I would cook and sell with a friends dad, I knew this was a good way to make quick money, but I promised I never do it bc I saw how just an average, not tweaker meth head looked, and trust me a lot of average users in my state look a step up from a well known website and project that posts a lot of before and after photos. A few years went by(24-25) and one night hanging out with 2 longtime close friends, I arrive and a pookie soon comes out, I just say fuck it and try it they roll it for me and I got a good strong hit, felt like the last time I did it honestly, I think it was either trash meth or they weren't they best at rolling(I'll get to why I think that soon), chilled with them from probably 830pm to 5am, was able to goto bed just fine. Woke up no cravings nothing, good to go like the last time. Nothing and I mean absolutely no amphetamine or meth use, I was very much against it. Flash forward 8 years give or take, May 12, 2024 my wife committed suicide right in front of me, she did not die from her final act and I tried to save her but I knew there was too much damage, I agreed with the doctor that with her 10% brain function and constant seizures, and on life support, my wife was no longer with me I would never have her back in anyway, so after 3 days I said okay to them taking her off, she took her last breath 27 min later. First everything was what you'd expect from that kind of grief and PTSD, my parents pay for my therapy bc I knew I wouldn't be able to function without it. Its been working fairly well since my therapist has PTSD from being in Global War on Terror as a combat medic, she was one of the first women they allowed to go on major combat missions during major pushes during the 2nd invasion of Ramadi, she saw a lot. So she only treats vets and suicide survivors like myself through EDMR style therapy and I go to group every month. Everything has been getting better very slowly but far better than almost a year ago. I have always smoked weed everyday so that's not new and my consumption didn't increase. I drank a little for the first month to month and a half after her passing but that like all the other habits I've ever had I can just go nah not anymore and I'm done no cravings, withdraws, etc. Now were gonna go to late February of this year I for some reason met out of ALLLLLL the meth users that come into my store to buy ""oil burners"" chose one guy to ask if he had some shard or could get some, he didn't look like your typical tweaker that would come in there, he was normal looking, acted normal, but was def a more than occasional user, he said yes and gave me his number, when I got paid a day later my dumbass went and got a gram from him, while I was there we smoked a bowl and I finally felt ""the flash"", didn't realize it that was set it's hooks into me. But I didn't smoke, I thought I could get away with snorting it and eating it in small amounts for a short time to fix my sleep, I absolutely did not do that. A week goes by of not doing any of that, get paid call him again to try again, smoked and then snorted the rest, no issues with eating or sleep but did not fix sleep schedule. Another week maybe week and a half go by and I call him again this time I did it bc I wanted some, mistake #1, I buy it and a bowl and smoke with him and while I'm going about my day but I still keep it minimal and I'm really shit about rolling a bowl so I burn it most of the time and decide to go back to snorting just more at a time. Few days go by and now I buy it to repeat the high, I spent the day with him fishing and smoking meth and bought 3 grams this time. I smoked all 3 grams in 5 days, I would account the first half a gram as wasted bc I burnt the shit out of it, then I turned to trusty reddit on how to properly smoke meth, well I sure as hell figured it out now and I was rolling almost perfect every time. And I smoked and I smoked during the 5 days I slept twice for about 10 hours total and ate 3 out of the 5 days and I did and always do stayed hydrated. Only this time when I ran out, it wasn't like the last 4 times where I just got sleepy and went to bed, I went into tweaker mode, carpet shard goblin and all. And about halfway though the day of this I'm finally like wtf are you doing? STOP NOW. Thank god for being prescribed an SSRI and Klonopin bc It's been 24 hours, I had a full day of sleep(10 hours) I ate 3 meals, been hydrating and I'm still having a hard time, still gritting my teeth, still craving finding myself when I go look for something I'll catch myself ""shard hunting"" for a second and I'm like dude fucking cut it out. Problem is this guy is a regular, and even though he'll be more than understanding about why I can't hang out with him anymore, I can't quit my job its not an option, but I can't stop the meth users coming in there to get bowls all the time or dude coming in to get cigs every other day. I have to keep this job and stay clean. Please give me advice on what to do and ways to mentally fortify myself, I don't want that crap about ""just stay strong"" or ""just say no""...duh, I wanna know what would you do as an ex user or addict in my shoes to prevent this, that's gonna give me a better idea on what to do.

She never ended up reading it. I want someone to see my heart. I know people in this community struggle with addiction. I know they struggle with many things. My heart goes out to all of you. Even if no one reads this, I want to put my heart on a platter from the daughters perspective of addiction. What I wrote below, it's what I desperately wished my mom knew when she thought I hated her.

Mama,

I know it’s weird to send a letter like this when we live in a day and age where phones and cars exist. I know I’ve made it hard for you to get in contact with me in those ways, but I needed to get my feelings out. Lately, and probably a lot of my life, it’s been hard for us to communicate with each other. Maybe it’s because we’re the only girls, or that we’re so alike, or maybe it’s just simply how life goes for two people who feel things so deeply. I hope you’ll read my full letter and its entirety. I had to type it out because I have a lot in my heart that I wish I could tell you. I have a lot of things that I want to get off of my chest. Please take the time to read it. I want to start off by telling you how much I love you, mama. I love you so much that sometimes I stay up at night and cry thinking that one day I’ll never see you again. I’ll cry thinking about how I haven’t seen you and that I miss you. I miss you so much. I don’t think I could put into words how I feel about you, mama. Out of every person on this Earth, I love you the most. I feel so complete when I’m with you. To me, you’re my safe place, you’re my home. You make me so happy, like a warm childish feeling. I could go without everything in the world if that meant I could be with you. I know I could handle losing some people, but I can’t handle losing you. I don’t ever stay up praying for someone like I stay up to pray about you. I don’t ever miss anyone but you. I don’t ever cry over being away from anyone but you. You mean so much to me, I don’t know how anyone could live without you.

Despite what you might think, I tell everyone how amazing my mama is, and how wonderfully she raised me. When I moved out, I cried myself to sleep every night because I wanted to be at home with you. I know that may sound conflicting to you because I’m the one that decided to leave, but I couldn’t stay there anymore. I wish that things were a bit more simple. I wish things were a lot more black and white between us. Between everyone in our family. Out of every person, I feel a connection to you that I can’t even begin to explain. I love my mama. I love you so much. I feel in my heart that you’re the most special woman in the world. You’re the most kind, the most funny, the most caring, the most beautiful, the most warm, and the most amazing person ever to exist. Despite how you may think I feel towards you, in my heart of hearts, you have all of me. You truly are the one who taught me how to love and to be loved. You did everything you could for me. You are everything to me. I love you with all of my soul that it hurts to think you aren’t here with me like you used to be. I wish we still had our family together. I think about you all the time. I know you think I talk badly of you, but if there's one thing I can say, it’s that I don’t want anyone thinking wrongly of you. When you do something, I know I can understand it. I know I can see what you were trying to do. Even though I can’t show you that, that’s how I feel in my heart. It’s so hard for me to show you any vulnerability or sympathy. It’s so hard for me to give you the comfort you need when you’re sad. It’s so hard for me to tell you that I know what you’re going through. I know I can feel your struggle, I don’t want anyone to get the wrong impression of you no matter what you’ve done. They don’t know you like I know you, why would I tell them anything that you did? Why would I bad mouth you? You hold so much of my heart Mom. I want our family to love each other. I don’t tell all of the drama to Justin like you think, or vice versa. We rarely speak about family.

How could I tell people who don’t understand you anything negative about you? You’re wonderful. You’re amazing. You’re truly the apple of my eye, mama. You are the best thing to ever happen to me. Why would I want someone else to think you weren’t precious? I don’t tell anyone anything. I don’t go out of my way to ruin things for you. I don’t go off and tell everyone the drama. I don’t think I’m better than you. I could never be the woman that you are or go through the things that you have. You are so strong. You are so thoughtful and willing to help others. You are very selfless. Why would I think I’m better than you? I know you feel like I think that, but it’s just not true. I look up to you in many ways, I know that you’re trying your best to keep everything together and I know that you’re the only one doing that. I would never think I’m better than you. You’re living a hard life. You’re doing very emotionally draining things. How could I think I’m better than you when you do something so rigorous? You’re a strong woman. A beautiful woman. You are a prize to be treasured. There’s no such thing as someone better than you. You have to believe me for a moment when I say that. There's not a part of me that looks down on you, or Dad, or Colbie in the sense that I believe I’m better. I think a lot of times, the two of us get lost in translation. We go off of what we believe the situation is rather than what it truly is. I don’t think I’m more righteous than you. I wish I could do more for you. I wish I could help you and make you happier. I wish I could be someone you could rely on more. I’m sorry I couldn’t give you that comfort. I’m sorry I’ve turned you away so many times. I’m sorry for all the times that I’ve been ungrateful. I’m sorry for being so rude to you and being so mean to you, mama. I’m sorry for not appreciating you more or making you feel like you weren’t good enough. I’m sorry for not giving you a shoulder to cry on or giving you the comfort you needed. I’m sorry that I wasn’t able to hold you when you needed it. I’m sorry for hurting your feelings intentionally and all the many times I did it unintentionally. You deserved a tender heart from me, but I was blind a lot of times to my words or to how you felt. I was blinded by my own pain and anger. I’m sorry for any time I’ve lied to you, any time that I’ve made you feel unhappy, any time that I made you feel like I was looking down on you. I’m sorry for anything I’ve done to come against you or hurt you. I’m so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry, mama.

I want you to be happy. I wish I could have been a lot better in the times where I wasn’t good enough. I want nothing but the best for you. I wish that I could take all of your pain away and I wish that I could press a button and have all of our issues wiped away, I wish our family could go back to normal. In this letter, I may say some things that you don’t agree with, but please, for me, please just read what I have to say. Please. I know things in our lives have taken a turn for the worse and it’s like a rollercoaster continuing to push forward in the wrong direction. Our family fell apart so quickly that it was hard to stop it. In reality, when I think about it, it’s all in slow motion. The slow grinding down of every one. I know that our family has struggled with many things, and I know that it’s hard to pinpoint it all. I come to you earnestly mom, I just want you to be honest with me. I just want you to give me some closure and something real. I need that from you Mom. Please. Please allow me this. I know. I know about a lot of things. I know and I don’t know. I know there are things that I’ll never know. You need to be honest with yourself. I know. I’m not trying to judge you, Mom. I’m not trying to hurt you. I just want my mama back so badly. I know you think it’s fine and I know you think things aren’t caused by what you’re doing. But they have been for a long time. This letter isn’t about Dad, but I know he's done more than his fair share of it too. It’s not that I’m just blaming you mama, but you don’t understand what I feel for you. I don’t feel the same things with Dad. I know it feels like I always let him off the hook or am being nicer to him, but it’s because I don’t expect him to do anything else. I expect so much from you because I know what you’re capable of. 

I don’t understand it myself. I don’t know why it’s so much easier to talk to Dad, or why it feels like I can forgive him so easily when I know deep down he’s nothing compared to you. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dad to pieces, but you... You were my mom and my dad for so much of my life. You were always there for me and raised me in the most loving, gentle, and warmest way possible. You did it perfectly, mama. I’m so proud of you. You held me when I cried, you rubbed my feet when they hurt, and you kissed my knees when I fell. You stayed with me. You loved me, you nursed me back to health when I was sick, you made me laugh when I was sad, you played games with me when I was bored. How could anyone be a better mother than you? You’re my person. It’s so much harder for me to forgive you. It’s so much harder for me to speak to you freely. It’s so hard for me because I just want to express to you how much I love you but I can’t help but hold things against you. I can’t help but be mad at you. I’m sorry about that. Something different about him, he’ll be honest with me, even if it’s just a little. He’ll apologize because he knows he’s an addict. An alcoholic. You’re so much more than these drugs, mama. Then those people who are claiming to have your back. Dad is more than the alcohol and addiction too. But you're something special mama. You’re so special. You’re like diamonds and gold, how can anyone be better than you? You’re more than all of this. You’re my world. I can’t help but hold everything against you because I want my mommy so badly. I want the mother who had that soft heart. I want the mother who wasn’t weighed down by the world. I want you. I want you back. I know that these drugs talk for you a lot of the time. I know it feels like you’re in a car with no breaks. I know things are happening so naturally around you that it’s hard to think that these drugs are the issue. I know that mama. I don’t blame you for being addicted. I don’t blame you for hustling. I don’t blame you for living the life that you feel was dealt to you. I don’t blame you for those things, and I don’t hold them against you. I don’t think you’re a bad person. I don’t think you’re disgusting. I don’t think you’re worthless. I don’t think that you’re unsavable. You’re more than any drug in this world, any lifestyle in this world. I don’t blame you for those things. I blame you for not facing those facts though. I blame you for not being honest with yourself and with me. I blame you for not having the dignity to realize that you’re not hiding the truth from anyone. You hurt others more by simply pretending you aren’t doing what you are. If you aren’t ashamed to do it in secret, you shouldn’t be ashamed to do it openly. I know. It’s not hard to tell. I can tell when you’re high. I can tell when you’re sober. I can’t tell every time you lie, but I know you do. Please just be honest with me. Please show me that. Please, mama.

I have suffered a lot in my childhood, but I know many people have. I have gone through a lot of pain in my life, but I know many people have. I know that things and life aren’t always normal. I wish you could be honest with me. If you would give me that, it would be so much easier for me to forgive you and have us move on. We don’t have to live like this forever. Our family doesn’t have to suffer forever. It starts with being honest. You need help. There's nothing wrong with that. I just want things to change and move on from this, I want to grow our lives and be together again. I want to come over to the house and feel welcomed again. I want to see you and feel loved again. I want to hold you and feel like a kid again. I want to show you my heart and not feel scared that you’ll get high again. I want you to leave the drugs behind. I want you to be able to start a new life that you can actually be happy in. I want you back. I want these drugs to die and go to hell.

I know that when I moved out, you had a lot of thoughts about it. I know you thought someone was influencing me. The truth of that is Mom, I’m hardly swayed by others. Every time I confront you or try to talk to you about things that have happened, you always act like its other people who tell me what to say, but that’s simply not true. I have never been moved to say something I don’t believe. I have never been moved to hate you. People don’t talk about you as much as you think they do. When I would come over here to Nana's house before I moved out, none of us would speak on you or whatever situation was going on. We moved out to get away from all of that. I have always driven my own ship. I have always formed my own opinions. Nothing I have ever said to you was brought out by someone else. Justin never talks badly of you, in fact, he only talks about how much he loves you and wishes you would get the help you need. Same for Nana. We defend you more than most people do. It’s not fair for you to blame us in that way. When everything happened after the 4th of July, it wasn’t anyone else’s choice but my own to leave. I had warned you for months that I was going to move out if you and Dad didn’t change, but nothing happened. You didn’t believe me.  I told you in December that things needed to change or I wasn’t staying. The months went on. I tried to bring it up but nothing ever happened when I did. January, nothing. February, nothing. March, nothing. April, nothing. May, nothing. June, nothing. I couldn’t take it anymore. Both you and Dad refused to get the help you needed. The help I begged you to get. I want you to be happy Mom. I want you and Dad to change for the better. I’m sick of this life we seem to be stuck to. The last two years of our lives have felt like... honestly, hell. Alcohol, drugs, anger, violence, manipulation, and more have infested the structure of our family. I wanted change. I needed it. I begged for it. I tried to talk to you about it, I tried to warn you about it, but you would turn me away and get mad. You told me that I wasn’t going to move out. I realized you told me that you wanted the same change as me just so I’d shut up. You guys didn’t even falter when I told you I would leave. You were shocked when I actually did and blamed everyone but yourselves. You and dad. You had six months.

Do you think I wanted to move out mom? Do you think as a 17 year old that I wanted to pay my own bills? To burden the people around me to take me back and forth to work and school? To make all of my choices by myself? Do you think I wanted to be away from my home and my family? I was a child.. I forced myself to grow up and get somewhere that didn’t feel like a house of darkness and depression. I’ve done so much myself and I deserve some credit for that. I don’t deserve you blaming me for leaving. I don’t deserve you treating me like some spoiled brat. I don’t deserve you treating me like I think I’m better than you because I want more for myself. I didn’t deserve how much you guys put on me. I’m your daughter, not your emotional scapegoat. I’m not the one that’s supposed to bring happiness to the house and carry the burden of everyone's depression either. I don’t deserve you belittling me. I handle EVERYTHING on my own. I do EVERYTHING on my own. 

I tried my hardest to keep our relationship after I moved out. I’m the one who came to see y'all, I’m the one who called and texted y'all, I’m the one who forgave y'all. You guys wouldn’t let it go, you guys wouldn’t treat me equally, you guys made me feel like an outsider. That wasn’t fair to me. For the first month after moving out, it felt like I was mourning my family. It felt like I was mourning you. I cried and cried and cried. I laid in bed and sobbed myself to sleep every night because I didn’t have my mom. I want you back mom. I don’t want the drugs. I’ve forgiven you time and time again, the least you could give me is a little respect and honesty. If you want to be honest with me, I’ll always listen. I’ll never judge what you’ve done. If you lie to me again, I’ll continue to push you away. Trust is earned in droplets and lost by buckets. You have lost my trust. I love you. If you want to get in contact with me after you’ve read this entire letter, reach out through someone to let me know. If not, we’ll continue no contact. I love you, mama. I love you so so so so so much. I love you. I miss you. I wish things could heal between us, but I can’t be the only one healing it. I want you in my life. I need my mom. I need my dad. I need my parents while they're still around. I beg you mom. I beg and plead. I need you guys so badly. I just want to be with you guys. I just want yall to love on me and love me. Everyday it feels like I’m mourning the person that I love the most. I want my mom back. I want my dad back. I just want you guys to be happy and healthy. I want you guys to get away from whatever is holding you back. I want only the best for yall. I love you. I pray to God to keep you safe and help you to be happy. Please read this letter earnestly. Bye mom.

1jomxx9,Addiction,1743480641.0,"I did it. I’ve finally hit rock bottom. Today I’ve received news that my bachelors degree from 2 years ago has been revoked. 

4 years ago was when I developed an array of addictions. Numbed the fuck out of everything that hurt. I have done nothing but wallow in bed, contemplating the worst, and ruminating on my entire past self over these past few years. I was stuck in school and tried my best to be a functioning person. I ended up doing stupid dishonest shit to get by and my degree was taken away… I think it’s a bit ironic since I’ve dreamed of getting sober and becoming a lawyer and I fucked it all up. 

Now I have nothing. Homeless because I haven’t been able to hold down a job, I have a permanent mark on my transcript saying I’m a dishonest fuck and that my degree is revoked, I’ve burned bridges with friends and family. All because I chased short-term gains. 

I’ve been sober for a week now trying to process everything but holy hell it is hard. I’m shaking and I feel anxious everyday.

I can’t remember a week that I went without adderall and can’t remember a day I didn’t vape. 

Anytime I get paid, it’s the first things I think about spending my money on. 

When I try to quit, it’s the only thing I can think about. 

Now moving up to cocaine, I feel like it’s really starting to show to other people. 

I feel like I’m a better version of myself when I’m on these drugs. So when I’m not, I don’t feel confident. 

Completely lost in how to overcome this lifestyle.

1joj5zr,Addiction,1743468698.0,"Advice Needed on Being a Supportive Partner to Someone with Addiction Hi, my (21F) partner (22M) just opened up to me about his struggle with substance abuse and overall dependency on marijuana, nicotine and pornography. He decided, on his own accord last week, to quit it all and is now going through withdrawal symptoms. But overall, he is seeking help from his family, actively finding a therapist and has opened up to everyone close to him in his life (his friends, his family and me). We did talk recently, and he confessed to me that he has been using nicotine and marijuana daily and has consumed pornography regularly as well. I was very proud of him for opening up and telling me the truth. I know it took a lot of courage to do so, and I reassured him I will be there to support his recovery every step of the way. We even made a plan where he will give me weekly check-ins on his feelings and any general urges he has.

My main problem is that I feel incredibly hurt still, and I feel major guilt for even feeling this way. We had talks in the past (maybe a little over a year ago?) where he told me he quit nicotine, and another where I mentioned his pornography use has influenced the way I perceive myself and my overall confidence in our relationship. Anyways, he did not quit when we initially talked about it. It hurts because it feels like this past year has been a lie. I can't help but think of all the times he would seem spaced out or high, and I just never noticed or passed it off as him being tired.  I may have also dropped the ball at times. I was too afraid to ask him, out of fear he would think I don't trust him. I don't know, I feel like I'm a bit out of my depth here. I want to help him, but I really don't know how without sorting through my emotions first, and I just don't know who to reach out to. I don't know anyone in my life who can help.

At the end of the day, I know his substance issues are a symptom of a much bigger problem; he is aware of this as well, which is why he is going to therapy asap. But I feel like for me to be the best supporting partner I could be, I need to address my own feelings about how his addiction has hurt me.

1joev6u,Addiction,1743456902.0,"The Inner Secret There's something you don't want to look at.

Something ugly and uncomfortable that you aren't proud of.

Maybe it's the way your relationship is going. Maybe it's drinking a bit too much. Maybe it's the hours you spend browsing YouTube and playing mobile games that just leave you feeling empty and like you've wasted your vitality afterward. Maybe it's that p\*\*n habit that's still not under control.

Regardless of what it is, it's normal for your brain to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable, yucky situations you may be facing.

But where most guys go wrong is they let that resistance stop them.

And interestingly, that pretty much guarantees that the yucky, uncomfortable bullshit will perpetually be a plague for them. Nothing significantly changing, certainly not for the better, often for years on end...

On the other hand, I've seen a certain type of guy.

They're the kinds of guys I love to work with 1-on-1, and they're also the kinds of guys who are actually my friends in the real world too. Guys who are willing to take a good look at themselves and work on any aspect of themselves that needs some attention, regardless of the discomfort it may make them feel.

Because they know a secret:

That if they feel a lot of resistance towards something *that they objectively know would be good for them,* then that's exactly where they should be looking, and they lean into that resistance.

Making themselves take a closer look, even if it hurts.

So I invite you to adopt that kind of mentality.

If there's something you've been avoiding because it feels yucky and uncomfortable and you wish it wasn't the way it is... well, the way to change it is to own it and face it.

""If I ignore it for long enough it'll go away..."" is a loser's mentality that just flat out isn't true, especially in the case of relationship disharmony and addictive tendencies.

What a lot of guys don't realize, either, is that their p\*\*n habit is sneakily connected to every one of the other most common things guys struggle with.

Let me explain.

Many men struggle to stay consistent in their disciplines - and if their brain's dopamine reward center is burned out from pornography, that's not surprising, because consistency relies on a healthy dopamine reward center that's functioning as it should.

Many men struggle with connection in their relationships - and p\*\*n trains them to satisfy their own needs without a real partner being involved, undercutting their partners and their potential partners with a pixel-harem that'll do anything they want at the tap of a finger.

Many men struggle with anxiety - and p\*\*n is something that fundamentally fractures their self-esteem and confidence, causing that anxiety to spike after they indulge.

Many men struggle with spending way too much time on technology - and that's a form of escapism that's reinforced by using p\*\*n, too. If your brain's reward center is desensitized to the normal pleasures of life, because it's used to the ""super-high"" stimulation of p\*\*n, it basically won't want to engage with those ""normal"" aspects of your lifestyle as much, preferring the screen or the booze or the whatever that give it quick, easy dopamine and escapism.

Which is why quitting p\*\*n is one of the cornerstone steps in the modern man's self-improvement journey.

Because leaving that self-destructive habit in place negatively influences all the other areas that are worth giving a shyt about.

And removing it, conversely, helps uplift those areas.",inner secret theres something dont want look something ugly uncomfortable arent proud maybe way relationship going maybe drinking bit much maybe hours spend browsing youtube playing mobile games leave feeling empty like youve wasted vitality afterward maybe pn habit thats still control regardless normal brain feel resistance towards taking deeper look uncomfortable yucky situations may facing guys go wrong let resistance stop interestingly pretty much guarantees yucky uncomfortable bullshit perpetually plague nothing significantly changing certainly better often years end hand ive seen certain type guy theyre kinds guys love work theyre also kinds guys actually friends real world guys willing take good look work aspect needs attention regardless discomfort may make feel know secret feel lot resistance towards something objectively know would good thats exactly looking lean resistance making take closer look even hurts invite adopt kind mentality theres something youve avoiding feels yucky uncomfortable wish wasnt way well way change face ignore long enough itll go away losers mentality flat isnt true especially case relationship disharmony addictive tendencies lot guys dont realize either pn habit sneakily connected every one common things guys struggle let explain many men struggle stay consistent disciplines brains dopamine reward center burned pornography thats surprising consistency relies healthy dopamine reward center thats functioning many men struggle connection relationships pn trains satisfy needs without real partner involved undercutting partners potential partners pixelharem thatll anything want tap finger many men struggle anxiety pn something fundamentally fractures selfesteem confidence causing anxiety spike indulge many men struggle spending way much time technology thats form escapism thats reinforced using pn brains reward center desensitized normal pleasures life used superhigh stimulation pn basically wont want engage normal aspects lifestyle much preferring screen booze whatever give quick easy dopamine escapism quitting pn one cornerstone steps modern mans selfimprovement journey leaving selfdestructive habit place negatively influences areas worth giving shyt removing conversely helps uplift areas,1,0,Positive,Low Concern
1joenza,Addiction,1743456402.0,"Xanax Addiction I hate this stuff so much. I had been on benzos on and off for 20 years, mainly Klonopin which was much easier to titrate off of.

I was on Klonopin but got switched to Xanax over a year ago back when Klonopin manufactures were all on back orders. So my Dr switched me to Xanax 2mg 3x a day the same dose of Klonopin I was prescribed except I was only actually taking the Klonopin 2mg 2x a day. 

I just want to get off of this stuff so bad. I beat a heroin addiction that I had but this stuff to me is harder to kick than heroin. 

I have a refill on my Xanax next week and appointment next month. I’ve been contemplating scheduling my appointment earlier before my refill to get it switched over to Klonopin again so I can start lowering my dose. In my experience Klonopin was always much easier to taper off of but this Xanax doesn’t last long at all. I take it and read about all the negative stuff and a few hours laster take another 2mg pill to where it’s up to 6-8mg a day now.

I am scared because I don’t have resources for rehab, I have a job, a life and everything is great but this medication is ruining everything. I want to schedule my appointment this week before my upcoming refill to ask my Dr to cancel it to switch it back to Klonopin instead of Xanax because I don’t want to do another month of this and wait til my 3 month follow up with him.

I get weird anxiety that in make it early right before my refill he is gonna cut me off which I know is illogical and just my anxiety because cutting some off of 6mg of Xanax a day is life threatening. I don’t know if I should go in this week show him I’m still taking them and have the remaining pills I should until my refill and so him to cancel it and switch it with Klonopin or just try and cope with it another month and go to my regular 3 month follow up.

My rebound anxiety in the morning is so bad sometimes I have to call off work. I had to call off today or sometimes I’ll set my alarms for 6:45am to take my meds, then have my second one set for 7:30 so when I wake up I don’t feel so awful.

1jobixg,Addiction,1743448703.0,"Just some thoughts from my past journey and things I wish somebody told me. I'm not sure how to start this, but it's something I am grateful I finally found out when I hit rock bottom.

I have been you. You've tried everything you can think of and you've failed. Night and day you fight with the demons inside you. You wrestle with your own brain and you wish you could win. But how can you outsmart yourself? How can you overpower your own brain? It knows what your plan is, where you're going, when you're tired and weak and unable to fight. And no matter how long you make it, how long you are good for, how long you fight—it's never enough. Eventually, you will fail. And they will be right. You can't beat it, and you are a failure for it.

Well, I'm here to tell you—they're right. Tada! Turns out we are failures, and we can't get it right, and we will never be able to fix it. We suck at fixing it. And honestly, the feeling to give up trying isn't 100% wrong. But it is like 5% wrong.

What it's missing is the fact that there *is* a way out. The little 5% gap where it is possible to change.

Now the problem? That 5% is in different places for each person. But I can tell you where it's *not* at. That's pretty much the same for everyone:

- It's not in praying harder.
- It's not in hoping harder.
- It's not in sheer willpower or strength.
- It's not in distance from the problem.
- It's not in new patterns of self-destruction.
- And it's definitely not accepting your fate as an addict.

I've tried all of those—repeatedly, in different ways and flavors and combinations. They all lead to the same feelings of shame and fear and hurt and hopelessness and depression and anxiety and sadness and hate.

Now, while that escape from addiction is going to be different for every person in every process, the fundamental power behind it will always be the same:

You have to quit lying.

- Lying to yourself about being able to fix it.
- Lying to others about how bad it is.
- Lying about where you are and what you're doing.
- Lying about the effects it has on you and the things you care about.

The worst shame of it all is being caught in these lies.

I promise you—*the lies about it hurt worse than the addiction itself.*

---

Now, I can't tell you where your path leads. I don't know your specific issues and circumstances. But I do know how I got out, and the general things that allowed me to do so.

I hit rock bottom one day, and at 4 in the morning in a stranger's bathroom, I sent a text out to everybody that I had been lying to about my issue—my now ex, my religious leader, and my therapist.

I then spent the next month telling everybody that was connected to me and my addiction—my parents, siblings, friends, roommates—everybody I could think of that I had lied to. And let me tell you, that was the beginning of the end.

So far, I've been in an addiction recovery program for over a year. I have a stretch of sobriety, but honestly, that part doesn't even matter to me anymore. Sobriety days are just a number.

Don't get me wrong, I find sobriety to be very important in my life, but it's not what I was working toward. I was working toward breaking free of the addiction. And I have. I am not tied down to the shame and the lies. I have nowhere left to hide—and I love it. And it all came from leaving behind the lies.

Now, I highly recommend therapy. I think it's the best way to go about reconstructing your life. But you have to go in willing to be broken down, ripped apart, rearranged, and then rebuilt.

And if you can, join a support group. Find a group where you all have experienced somewhat of the same background and share. You’ll all find that even if it's not the exact same experience, you can understand where the problems are coming from—and why you're each struggling with them.

But if that's not for you, then find *somebody*. Just one person.

Someone you can tell *everything* to. Every excruciating detail. Every terrible thing you've done. Every hole you've found yourself in.

You have to get it out of you. You have to quit giving it the power to control you from the shadows.

So go get it done. You can't fix it, but you sure as hell can find somebody who can help you. Quit hiding, quit running, quit trying to lone-wolf it. Let yourself get ripped apart and fixed, and then you can go about your life how you wish it was.

—Just some guy on the internet

1jo5pki,Addiction,1743434428.0,"I realized, through my Dharma Recovery meeting, that the pinnacle of my addiction issues is I’m addicted to external validation. So, I’m someone who has bipolar and extreme PTSD. Like, there’s a reason why I’m 22 and I’m 100% completely estranged from the entirety of my family levels of extreme PTSD. 

I went to a Dharma Recovery meeting for the first time yesterday and then yoga through The Phoenix afterwards. I learned so much about myself and it’s been the most helpful recovery group I’ve ever been to (and I’ve tried them all—AA, NA, SMART Recovery, etc). If trauma is a main trigger for addiction issues, I really highly recommend Dharma Recovery. Anyways, because I stopped overthinking through the meditation practices and just let the thoughts flow through my head naturally, I realized a few things. First of all, while I went back to recovery groups for my DOC of cannabis and to make sure I stay off of the alcohol and meth I used to abuse, the core of my addiction is external validation. Why? As I put it in my meeting yesterday, in my childhood as a 3 year old, if I didn’t notice the slightest twitch of one of my parent’s eyes to see how they were doing, I had to worry if I was going to be alive in the next 5 minutes. So, I theorize I developed an addiction to external validation because it was the thing that kept me safe at that time. Second, after I realized this, I realized that I do not need external validation anymore to feel safe since, 95% of the time, I’m safe now because my family will never see me or hurt me again. My new mantra is “you don’t need external validation to be safe” and it’s so helpful. Third, when I did yoga afterwards, I told myself that I’m safe enough to let go of the physical tension in my body. A headache released in my head and I realized that I’ve had a headache 24/7 and didn’t realize it because it was just normal to me. 

In my last 11 days of sobriety, I’ve learned one very important thing. To be sober, you need to be 100% honest, stop escaping your reality, and accept it no matter how painful it is if you want to be sober. And, I realized that because external validation is truly the core of my addiction, I examined some of the friendships I had started re-introducing into my life. Then it hit me. I constantly feel extreme emotional pain 24/7 because, with how nuanced my life has been truly, people are just unable to understand my life. And, because I’ve been so traumatized to the point where trauma infects every conversation I have (minus small talk), I try to talk about things that are personally important to me (say, my struggles with bipolar or if people ask me how I discovered I was transgender) and I get invalidated every time. Because the core of my addiction is external validation, I feel so extremely hurt in every personal relationship I’ve ever had and the dynamic becomes extremely co-dependent every time. I also figured out why I keep attracting terrible people into my life. They must see that I was craving external validation. Point is, I realized that because of this addiction, having close, personal friendships are a very bad idea for me and I just want to be alone in that regard. Humans need social interaction, so I will socialize at my Dharma Recovery meetings, events my local AA club has, different clubs at my university, etc. However, I’m done talking to those people outside of when I go to engage in those communities (like, I’m not texting people outside of when I see them at a Dharma Recovery meeting for example). So, I explained this to the connections I had been reintroducing in my life. All of them got either pretty sad or angry, but I don’t care. It protects me and honestly, it protects them too. 

It was very difficult to accept at first, I won’t even lie. But, now that I’ve accepted it, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulder. I’m actually thinking things through more logically. I’m much more confident in a healthy way in the world. Before, it felt impossible to prioritize my needs (even eating). Now, I have zero issues eating. It sucks I’ll never have an emergency contact, but as an introvert, I’m very happy to engage in my communities when I need my human need of socialization and then just be by myself at home playing video games or watching funny videos on YouTube. I’m actually 100% comfortable being alone I found out. My two favorite things in the world right now is playing poker on my phone and doing yoga. I just had an addiction to external validation that was confusing me. 

I start intensive therapy for addiction recovery tomorrow that is 30 hours a week.

1jo1bi9,Addiction,1743421881.0,"Do I tell my family that I potentially ODed last night? Scared to scare them, worried they'll be angry or upset, don't know what to do I'm 20 so I'm over 18 and have the right to medical privacy. Thankfully no one contacted my family last night, that would've terrified them. I collapsed after doing quite a lot of (untested) ket and smoking weed. I'm a daily benzo addict and a poly addict (every day I use something that gets me high because the benzos don't but often swap between stuff. I've only done ketamine a few times before). I was talking to someone in my temporary accommodation at the time where I'm living because I'm homeless due to addiction, social services told my parents they had to kick me out after my addiction came out to them when I had a suicide attempt on illicit substances in my bedroom at my parents house. 

My family haven't been bad with my addiction or anything but they worry a lot. I've scared them and I hate that, I hate worrying them. But I also try to be honest with them because they want me to be. So far I've only told a friend and sent my key worker at the addiction service a message saying what happened. 

Last night an ambulance was called. Initially I collapsed and I'm not sure if I went unconscious. Then my breathing got harder, I felt like all my chest and esophagus was tight and I couldn't breathe properly. I was twitchy and tense and I remember having spasms. All my muscles are sore today. The paramedic was squeezing my collarbone hard at one point and I wasn't even responding to or feeling the pain, he checked after that he hadn't broken it because he said he was squeezing it hard. I haven't seen the notes so I don't know everything and I wasn't properly conscious for a lot of it so I remember the basics but not much. I know they said they gave me narcan twice (nasal and then IV) but didn't suspect opiates because it didn't do much. Apparently I had respiratory arrest. I remember having oxygen and something about co2 at some point? Something on my neck too. And an IV with stuff put in it. That's pretty much all I can remember. 

I discharged myself against medical advice last night at hospital. They did vitals and an ECG and took blood but I wanted to go before they got the results, I just wanted to go to bed and hospitals are a trigger so I needed to leave. They let me sign a form to go after assessing my capacity and making sure I knew the risks (respiratory depression, etc.). 

I feel like crap today. Nauseous, weak, tired, sore, dizzy, I just feel like crap which is probably to be expected. I still don't know what went wrong anyway, if there was something else in the ket or I ODed but I didn't think you could easily OD on ket? But apparently I looked and was bad. I felt bad, I thought I was gonna die. I felt like I was dying, my whole body was prickly and tingly and then everything felt muffled and I thought I was gonna go. 

But yeah I'm alive. And I don't know whether to tell my family anything. I haven't even told my best mate in case I scare him or he feels responsible because we did the same K together the night before though it was mine and I bought it and it was different then because I was careful and it was fun. Last night I was in a bad headspace trying to make it go away so I just used and used and kept snorting more.

1jnkl1p,Addiction,1743363443.0,"21 Days rule really works, I met my amazing GF because of this and saved my finance. Hi Guys, 

I am 26 Male, I work as Data scientist, I earn in 6 figures, being a Data Scientist is great, I love analyzing stuff. This is one of the main reasons I became a gambling addict. 

I though analyzing the patters and predicting according to the calculation will bring me big rewards and it did for some time. But as all things go I started loosing, at first it was small, like I would win 3 times and loose once, which is a great thing right. But that once became twice and I started loosing more than I earned. But then myaanalytic brain started to work and then started to invest big amount because I was certain even if I win once out of twice I will be getting profit because of the ratios. 

As you guys may guess after certain period of time I started to loose soo much that I lost count of, this has been going on for 2 years, I don't even know how much I lost, I would run out of money at the month end and would borrow money from parents, friends to make ends meet that month, I would of course return next month as soon as I get my salary, only to my friends and not parents, yes I took advantage of that. Thinking back, I am disgusted on myself. 

Everything changed 6 months back, I got a bonus on my job (it was a big amount, almost 6 months of my salary), I never spoke about my bonus to my friends or my parents and yes I gambled with that money, I literally lost 6 months worth of my salary in just 1 week, yeah in 7 days. That was the deciding moment when I realized I was addicted to gambling. I logged out of all gambling sites and uninstalled all the apps. This was the first time in 2 years where I lost all my money in first week of the month. I made sure I would not place a single bet or even open those sites till end of month. I would not borrow money from my friends and just borrow enough from my parents that would last me till the end of the month. 

2nd week was really tough, I was fighting a battle within myself to not borrow money from friends and place bets. But I started to realize few things that changed, I was more happy and slept peacefully, I started to exercise more to distract my mind. At the end of the month it was almost 22 days, I never felt like gambling. The best thing that came out of this was me falling in love with sports again. I never felt like watching games as soon as I ran out of money, but here I was enjoying games without even thinking about placing bets. 

I confessed to my parents everything that happened and how I overcame it. My parents moved in with me for sometime to help me overcome it, they made me go to therapy which helped me a lot. They went back after I started making progress. Every month from then I send certain amount to my parents to invest in Mutual funds and other investments. 

Next few months I saved money, this helped me to join my friends on a luxurious New Year Eve party, where I met my current GF, she is an amazing person and I confessed about my previous addiction (you know in case I relapse) she was and still is very supportive and is helping me a lot to make sure I am completely out of this. 

So yeah, those 21 days literally saved my life and made me meet probably the love of my life (well it's been only 3 months so). 

Thanks a lot for reading my confession and trust me guys 21 days helps a lot. 

Let me know if anyone of you have gone through this and how you guys came out of addiction

1jnhyxc,Addiction,1743356675.0,"Help with addictions!!! Hello,
I’m a 37-year-old man dealing with several addictions, and I’m seeking advice.

Addictions:

Weed
Porn
Masturbation
Phone usage
(And occasionally, alcohol)

Background:
Porn: I’ve been consuming porn since I was 16 and have never had a healthy relationship. Even after meeting my wife at 30, I never stopped, and the usage fluctuated.

Weed: Started at 27. It increased my libido, leading to more porn use and masturbation.


Relationship with Wife: I’ve always felt less physical attraction to my wife than I would consider normal, even though I deeply admire her personality. She is funny, witty, caring, smart, empathetic, sensible and a movie buff like me. I know she is objectively good-looking—though not like someone I used to admire before I met her. Despite that, I love her deeply. Our sex life has suffered, partly due to my low testosterone, varicocele, and weed usage. I regret how I’ve let this affect us, and I can’t help but feel guilty for being selfish.


Family: I love my wife and 18-month-old daughter deeply. I’m aware of my selfish nature and want to change for them.


Addiction: I’ve been struggling with my addictions for years, and my wife is tired of hearing me complain. I need advice and encouragement to break free.


Weakness: I’m mentally weak and often give in to temptation. I used weed during my wife’s pregnancy despite her requests not to, which led to a fight.


Phone Usage: While not excessive, I believe reducing phone usage could improve my stagnant career and overall life.


Attempts to Quit: I’ve tried many times to quit these habits but failed each time.


Work and Relationship Issues: I’m laid-back by nature, and my wife feels I don’t help enough at home, especially with a full-time job and a child. My low testosterone makes me tired, which is why I want to reduce phone addiction.


Career Depression: I don’t love my job and feel depressed about it. I plan to stay for at least 10 more years to secure a good future for my family.

I’d appreciate any advice or even just acknowledgment. I feel mentally weak, like the gambler in Dostoevsky’s novel, struggling with these addictions.",help addictions hello im yearold man dealing several addictions im seeking advice addictions weed porn masturbation phone usage occasionally alcohol background porn ive consuming porn since never healthy relationship even meeting wife never stopped usage fluctuated weed started increased libido leading porn use masturbation relationship wife ive always felt less physical attraction wife would consider normal even though deeply admire personality funny witty caring smart empathetic sensible movie buff like know objectively goodlookingthough like someone used admire met despite love deeply sex life suffered partly due low testosterone varicocele weed usage regret ive let affect us cant help feel guilty selfish family love wife monthold daughter deeply im aware selfish nature want change addiction ive struggling addictions years wife tired hearing complain need advice encouragement break free weakness im mentally weak often give temptation used weed wifes pregnancy despite requests led fight phone usage excessive believe reducing phone usage could improve stagnant career overall life attempts quit ive tried many times quit habits failed time work relationship issues im laidback nature wife feels dont help enough home especially fulltime job child low testosterone makes tired want reduce phone addiction career depression dont love job feel depressed plan stay least years secure good future family id appreciate advice even acknowledgment feel mentally weak like gambler dostoevskys novel struggling addictions,10,1,Neutral,Moderate Concern

1jneqlx,Addiction,1743348086.0,"Anyone experience ""withdrawal dreams?"" For context, I was addicted to opioids for more than a decade. Hard-core, terrible addiction. Relapsed many times. I'm 2 years, 2 months, 1 week, and 1 day sober today. 

Here's my question: has anyone else experienced incredibly vivid dreams while going through withdrawals or going cold turkey? Like dreams that you still remember now that you're sober and kind of.. haunt you? I feel like this has to be a phenomenon others have experienced but I've never known who to ask about it, and didn't feel AA/NA meetings were the place to get answers from a wider audience. 

I had these dreams several times when I either went cold turkey, or ran out of my DOC, or before ""coming to"" after a bad bout of withdrawal. Many times they were so vivid, I'd have a hard time after trying to discern if parts of these dreams had actually happened.

1jne219,Addiction,1743346197.0,"Former long term heroin addict: Benadryl withdrawal is the next worst thing 
Putting this out there because it is not widely known. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) withdrawal for some people can be nearly as bad as long term opiate withdrawal. 

I was a daily heroin addict for 5 years. I have used Benadryl as a sleep aid at different times in my life. Withdrawals from Benadryl can be nearly as bad as heroin withdrawal, including delirium and psychosis. I have had two friends who became psychotic and suicidal from it and had to be hospitalized. 

The fact that people can walk into any shop and start taking it nightly without any warnings or doctor’s oversight is a real shame. Most people have no idea what they’re getting into and don’t find out until it’s too late. Some never make the connection. 
 
You can google search for peer reviewed medical papers on it, just providing some first-hand testimony here, and a word of caution.

And once I get a supply, something in me refuses to stop until it's all gone, used. I can't even convince myself to flush it. I don't know where this ""I ain't a quitter"" bullshit came from in my head, but I can't shake it. I am out, again. Used way fucking more this time. What normally would've lasted two weeks only lasted four days. The last several times have been the same. My therapist and my case worker keep trying to help me with harm reduction, but I've come to realize that just don't work with me. If I have stuff, I'm gonna use it. And if I have money when my cravings get bad, I'm gonna get stuff. I don't even have my numbers saved, I just know the places to go.

Did NA for a while. Got a bunch of numbers. Tried for the 90 in 90, but only got to 26 in 28. Every number I called or texted never responded back. Hell, I'd stick around after every meeting to try to talk to someone, but they were always too busy with their friends. I got two people to talk to me for a little bit. They still didn't respond to texts. And I never did find anyone willing to sponsor. Tried five different rooms. Idk. Maybe I have a weird vibe. Fuck if I know. My friends like me, my girlfriends like me. The people at NA, not so much. Lol.

Anyway, I've been off shit for four days (as of today). After the last bit, I finally crashed out and slept for a day and a half. Still getting things back into a semblance of a schedule. And I got a lot of things coming up this week. My partners are gonna be here for a few days, and I got a wedding I'm going to this weekend. I got money coming, too. Not sure that's a good thing. I mean, yeah, gotta pay the bills. But there's always just enough left over to ruin my life a little more. I mean, I guess it's not like I got a lot of time left, anyway.

1jnal18,Addiction,1743334742.0,"Tw; addiction , mental health, children My child was born addicted to opiates, then got into fentanyl at 1 years old and was taken from me. I almost got her back and relapsed about two weeks ago. I hate myself for the harm I caused my child sometimes I feel she be better off without me. She almost 2 now 


Ever since I lost all access to my child, all I’ve wanted to do was die. I spent all week trying to OD on fentanyl, but it wouldn’t work because of my tolerance. So I acquired other drugs, I figured a good mix of Methadone and benzos would take me out. It’s a lethal combo. I also was gonna mix it with gabapentin, Seroquel, and whatever else. But now that I finally have all the drugs I’m not as sad and suicidal. I still miss my baby, but I’m starting to have a hope that maybe I can change and be a good mother but at the same time I’ve had this hope before and I’ve always fallen apart. I’ve been a heroin since I was 17 , I’m 26, and I’m just so tired of fighting so tired of the cycle of homelessness of rehabs of doctors of dcfs taking my baby over and over again , of jails , short periods of sobriety, just to do it all again . , when I’m sober sometimes I’m happy, but I’m mostly fighting the urge not to use , and when , I can’t live my whole life fighting the urge not to use, and I can’t live my whole life in the rehab jail homelessness thing either , I’m just done, I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m gonna regret it in the future if I don’t kill myself now, but for some reason, I have a little hope today.

1jn6qny,Addiction,1743317279.0,"I’m finally ready for a change Been an addict for ten years and it stole my life away. Before I got into drugs at 17 I was a musician full of passion, drive, creativity, and excitement for my future. But drugs slowly took over everything. It was so fun and exciting to learn about them at first and be stupid with my friends but I became obsessed and then felt like I needed substances to be normal or around anyone socially. It started with cigarettes, alcohol, weed. Then I got into some pills from here and there, bars, psychs, GHB MDMA, all the main drugs people think of. Some I used with a lot of restraint, but other substances I full on abused. Alcohol, GHB, benzos, weed, and kratom the most. I used to be so productive and put all of myself into art, I even stupidly thought the drugs would help inspire my art, which psychs can for sure, but ultimately when you get dependent you spend all your time trying to maintenance the addiction and it makes it impossible to really dedicate yourself to anything. At least that’s how it was for me because I have bpd and I was always running away from home scared to commit to anything and build a life for myself. I basically squandered all my potential and it’s been to painful to bare what I’ve done to my life because I loved where I was headed so much before this. I’ve lost everything I loved. I’ve sold so many of my instruments for drugs, distanced myself from my family, didn’t dedicate myself the way I should have and fought so much with partners from being high and overly triggered with my inhibitions down. I romanticized and glamorized this addicted life of mine and every time I would try to get completely clean I would just feel so bored and miserable like sober life just isn’t worth living. But I’m finally tired. The latest addiction I’ve had is kratom and it’s literally killing my body. I’m way underweight, my boobs are shriveling from hormonal imbalance, I’ve gotten so many injuries from using it with other substances and hurting myself and the wounds not healing properly, I had utis almost everyday for six months straight, my skin looks sickly, I’m aging faster, I just look strung out and tired all the time. I don’t want to end my twenties off only living the same ground hogs day of living in my grandpa’s house just making enough money ubering to buy more feel frees and vapes, I’m proud that I’m not on any street drugs anymore, but kratom is honestly worse than all of them for me because it’s affecting my body the worst and it’s so accessible. I’ve been resigning myself to this thinking I deserve to suffer like this, feeling sorry for myself. Waking up everyday feeling like I’m going to have a stroke or pass out wondering how much I’ve damaged myself. I’m just at an all time low and I’m tired. I’m tired of being poor, filthy, underfed, and unhappy. I want to finally reclaim myself and my life and stop acting like I’m just a victim that’s cursed to be addicted forever because I have mental health issues and hate the world. I want to finally get over not just my addictions but maybe even get my OCD treated so I can stop living in paralysis and be a person again. I’ve been scared and felt like I had no resources but I do I just have to put a lot of work in to get to them but I have to start doing something about myself, for me. I don’t want to let my body go anymore and I don’t want to hate myself forever even if I have way too much trauma and am fixated on all the negative aspects on my life and the world, I just want to finally be a person again. I don’t want to just live for some fantasy of male validation and drugs and sex and “being a maverick” anymore. I want to stop fighting people and just live my life for me and stop blaming others as an excuse to continue to use. I don’t like 12 steps but I have to be able to find something that works for me. I just felt completely alone and defeated but there has to be people out there that will at least let me hold a space in the world even if I’m not perfect or they don’t like me.

1jn546z,Addiction,1743310352.0,"Cocaine addiction Hi all. I wanted to get others perspectives being that I don’t feel comfortable enough to share my addiction with my family or friends. I started using cocaine about 6 months ago with my significant other (who no longer uses and never did as much as me). At first, it was just every now and then when we were together. As of about 4 months ago, it became a daily thing for me. I usually consume 3g a day (insane, I know) & don’t see myself quitting anytime soon. I just fear the repercussions of quitting, especially since I’ll have to go through it alone. 

For most, this addiction makes them a lower version of themselves (so I’ve read), but I feel people have liked me more in the last few months (coworkers, family) than they ever have. I feel like I’m a nicer person and much more enjoyable to be around. I don’t fight as much with my family as I used to, and I don’t get as down at work and nasty as I used to. 

I have noticed things about myself that other people have mentioned; my short term memory is spotty, I find myself looking for specific words when conversing way more often than I used to, etc. I just don’t know what to do, and was looking for other people’s stories/experiences with quitting long term, high volume usage.

In advance, thank you to all who share, and to those who don’t feel comfortable sharing, you’re not alone and I hope this post helps you too.

now, it started as a little bit of weed here and there and escalated to taking a mix of MDMA, Speed, Coke and crumbled Ecstasy every few days.

Then a week ago i decided that i want to stop because it was getting out of hand, i was clean for 2 weeks and then felt kinda bored so i bought some more speed (im high while writing this).

And i know that when the effects come down ill feel like shit and wanna kill myself, and all i will think of is the rush and the intense high you get while still being able to function.

I need to find stuff to do to get me as exited as doing drugs, while i have one hobby, drumming, but i almost have no time for it cuz im working 10 hours a day 6 days a week and on my day off i usually would get drugged out to oblivion or just sleep for 17 hours.

1jmu13d,Addiction,1743276238.0,"im grateful my life fell apart. that sounds so backwards but its true. i had ODd on a synthetic version of kratom causing severe vertigo, long story short it resulted in going to the ER 3 times, then having to spend two nights in the hospital. vertigo causing me not to be able to walk + detox symptoms was hell, on top of my sister witnessing all of this. to now having $17 to my name while owing a shit ton of money etc etc. 



the thing is, if my life DIDNT fall apart, i wouldnt have hit 30 days. i could barely hit two-three weeks sober. i thought that sober = miserable. today i am grateful to be sober for 30 days. i'd say ""only"" but we all have to start somewhere. sobriety feels peaceful for the first time in over a year. i'm not littered with constantly wanting to relapse, thinking drugs were the only way to feel better.



 i kept thinking there was no negative consequences. that i just needed to learn to cover up my use more, needed to hide more, because it only negatively affected those around me. i thought i was acting the same. i was so deep in denial to what drugs were doing to my life i became delusional. it was so hard to face reality that the exact reason i was doing so bad was addiction. its like i knew but i didnt. i continually blamed my issues on depression, my depression was an excuse to keep using. 

  
i believe in some sort of god. to me it really felt like the downfall of losing all this money, losing my job, and developing vertigo all had a purpose. it had to happen. i went from oweing my bank $80 to $7 to having $17. i used to be horrible to my mom, ungrateful for everything. but she has been struggling for months financially because of the choice i made to put drugs over everyone else. but she has been here for me, she hasnt kicked me out, and despite being disappointed she has forgiven me. shes been giving me opportunities to make money. even $40 was something. 

  
i am doing so much better mentally. i feel like im coming up on my battle with addiction. im moving onto better days. i do need to take my ass to a meeting to be able to maintain this of course. im trying to kick myself to do online meetings because if i wanna keep what i have i have to put the work in. 

  
i thought drugs were what made me creative. but ever since i got sober, ive written a bunch. i am in a fandom right now on tumblr which has become a way for me to connect with people.. even people asying theyre EXCITED to read my fan fictions. or the sims i make, the edits i make etc. i'm actually writing a story right now. my creativity has INCREASED now that i dont want to only sit around doing nothing. now that i can have fun without drugs. 

  
this was my rock bottom. the past few months i was digging deeper and deeper. addicts will hit rock bottom and STILL dig. there was nowhere to go from there but up. and every little accomplishment is amazing to me. in active addiction i was ungrateful and entitled. its weird how much my mindset has changed from 30 days ago up to now.

UPDATE: so someone asked but the comment has disappeared. Yes I worked in sales I specialised in gold silver and platinum coin sales everything from roman coinage to modern day sovereigns. For our non uk friends. British coinage was at one point made of gold. I basically sold these to investors not only on the gold value but the rarity of the coins. The company I worked for reworded us sales agents woth free alcohol weekly paid pub trips to boost morale etc etc. Out of the 32 members in my team 26 of them did cocaine. Managers directors and our hr staff did cocaine. I was coerced into trying cocaine after our summer bbq the temperature was hot I drank way to much alcohol and was completely drunk. My manager came to me and offered multiple times told me I'd be sorted if I did a bump. I did it and well it became quite a regular thing to do at first enjoyed it. Did it whilst on the sales floor with other agents and did well selling etc. However I noticed it became a problem for me when I made My younger sister cry to tried to pull a small prank something so trivial it shouldn't have bothered me but I went off the Rail. 

As mentioned I have stopped using day to day and now when I drink which is only weekend. I crave it now if I stay with the friend group I made I crave but don't want to participate or get on it like I used to. However occasionally my old colleagues bump into me and I fall back into habbits.

Any advice on how I could cut it out completely or a way to deal with the crave whilst drinking ",year old male years back think years ago worked sales high pressure environment presured co workers drink take cocaine sales night outs aswell sales floor end week moment completelyshit faced rough week keys guys however unfortunately become quite addicted wanting bag whenever start drinking comes conditions however im certain group people want im others dont group dont force ive asked hide ask involved however always end trying get hands even arnt participants advice could want could possibly partake slightly maybe go top already beaten daily addiction every day sales floor im still weak comes drinking sometimes one particular group update someone asked comment disappeared yes worked sales specialised gold silver platinum coin sales everything roman coinage modern day sovereigns non uk friends british coinage one point made gold basically sold investors gold value rarity coins company worked reworded us sales agents woth free alcohol weekly paid pub trips boost morale etc etc members team cocaine managers directors hr staff cocaine coerced trying cocaine summer bbq temperature hot drank way much alcohol completely drunk manager came offered multiple times told id sorted bump well became quite regular thing first enjoyed whilst sales floor agents well selling etc however noticed became problem made younger sister cry tried pull small prank something trivial shouldnt bothered went rail mentioned stopped using day day drink weekend crave stay friend group made crave dont want participate get like used however occasionally old colleagues bump fall back habbits advice could cut completely way deal crave whilst drinking,6,1,Neutral,Low Concern

How To Live A Recovery Lifestyle – Tips From A Peer Recovery

Support Specialist

As a person living in recovery from Substance Use Disorder for the past 6 years, I have

developed some basic methods and tools that I use to maintain my recovery and

reclaim my life. I work as a peer recovery support specialist at my community health

department. My job is one of the driving forces that helps me maintain my recovery.

There is something so special about sharing your experiences to help someone else

find the light in their darkness. In addition to my job, I practice self-awareness to keep

myself on my toes, and I check in with myself about my emotions and the state of my

mental health to ensure my sobriety.

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a challenging journey that impacts not just the body

but also the mind and spirit. What I have learned is that living in recovery is not merely

about abstaining from substances; it’s about rebuilding a balanced and healthy life. At

the heart of this process is mental health and wellness. By prioritizing mental well-being,

we, in recovery can strengthen their resilience, address underlying emotional pain, and

build a foundation for sustained sobriety.

Why Mental Health Matters in Recovery

Substance use often masks deeper issues such as trauma, anxiety, depression, or

unresolved emotional pain. For me, I didn’t want to feel any of it. Without addressing



these underlying challenges, the risk of relapse increases. Mental health and wellness

practices provide tools to:

1. Understand Emotional Triggers: Recognizing the emotions and situations that

lead to cravings can empower individuals to respond constructively.

2. Rebuild Self-Worth: Substance use can erode self-esteem. Mental health

practices help individuals rediscover their value and purpose.

3. Develop Coping Strategies: Healthy coping mechanisms reduce the reliance on

substances to manage stress or discomfort.



Mindfulness Techniques in Recovery

Mindfulness or the ability to be self-aware is an empowering practice. It can help you

identify your emotions and stress levels and use the necessary tools to work through

them. Deep breathing techniques are my go to when I feel an anxiety attack coming on.

I am able to say to myself “It’s ok. Calm down. This is just your anxiety, and it will pass.”

I also practice making gratitude lists daily. It is too easy to focus on the negatives and

the have-nots. Making a gratitude list every day is a pleasant reminder of all the things

that I do have and value. Things that I didn’t have in addiction and thought I would never

obtain.

Mindfulness is a powerful tool for recovery. By fostering awareness and presence,

mindfulness helps individuals:



 Reduce Stress: Practices like meditation, deep breathing, and body scans calm

the mind and body, reducing the stress that often triggers cravings.

 Enhance Emotional Regulation: Mindfulness helps individuals observe their

emotions without judgment, allowing them to respond rather than react

impulsively.

 Cultivate Gratitude: Simple mindfulness exercises, such as journaling about

positive experiences, shift focus from negativity to positivity, improving overall

outlook.

 Use Mindfulness and Affirmation Cards: Tools like mindfulness cards or

positive affirmation cards provide daily reminders to stay present, encourage

positivity, and foster resilience.

 Make Gratitude Lists: Regularly listing things you are grateful for fosters a

positive mindset and helps shift focus away from challenges.



EMDR Therapy: Healing from Trauma

I recently started my journey with EMDR therapy. It is something I have been putting off

for fear of the discovery process. So far it has been an enlightening experience. It’s not

easy, that’s for sure, but I feel it is the next necessary step for me to overcome some of

the barriers I struggle with.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is particularly

effective for individuals recovering from SUD who have experienced trauma. EMDR

helps:

 Process Traumatic Memories: By reprocessing distressing memories,

individuals reduce their emotional intensity and impact.

 Break Negative Thought Patterns: EMDR can help shift self-defeating beliefs,

such as \&quot;I’ll never recover,\&quot; into more empowering narratives.

 Strengthen Emotional Resilience: Over time, individuals build the capacity to

face triggers without relapsing.

The Role of Regular and Group Therapy

I thrive in group therapy. I go to group therapy once a week. I appreciate the feedback

from the other members. I also enjoy the bonding that is done by sharing our stories

with each other. It’s so easy to learn from others when you have shared similar

experiences. It is also easier to identify certain things in someone else and then relate

them back to yourself. The members of my group therapy provide a mirror that I can see

myself clearly in.



Therapy provides a safe space for individuals to explore their thoughts and emotions,

understand their behaviors, and develop healthier patterns. Both individual and group

therapy play essential roles:

 Individual Therapy: Personalized sessions allow for in-depth exploration of

personal struggles, goals, and progress. Therapists can tailor strategies to meet

specific needs.

 Group Therapy: In group settings, individuals find community and support.

Sharing experiences fosters connection and reduces the isolation often

associated with addiction.

Mental Health Check-Ins: Building Consistency

Regular mental health check-ins—whether with a therapist, a trusted support group, or

through self-reflection—are vital in maintaining progress.

I practice mental health check-ins with myself regularly. Being able to identify how you

are feeling in the current moment is so powerful. It can help you to accept where you

are right now and where you want to be both emotionally and in life. These check-ins:

 Identify Emerging Issues: Early detection of stressors or negative thought

patterns allows for timely intervention.

 Track Progress: Reflecting on how far one has come boosts motivation and

confidence.

 Reinforce Healthy Habits: Routine check-ins help solidify practices like

mindfulness, gratitude, and self-care.

Journaling for Reflection and Growth

Journaling can be difficult, but it is a great outlet. I don’t journal every day. I’m just not

disciplined enough. However, I do try to journal when moments of joy, pride, sorrow, or

unsureness happen in my life.

Journaling is a transformative tool in recovery. By writing regularly, individuals can:

 Process Emotions: Journaling provides a safe outlet for exploring and

understanding emotions.

 Track Progress: Recording daily experiences and milestones highlights growth

and areas needing improvement.

 Enhance Clarity: Reflective writing helps organize thoughts, set goals, and build

self-awareness.

The Importance of Eating Healthy and Regular Exercise



I struggle with this one. I was raised in a household where you ate your feelings. It has

been one of the hardest habits to break in my life. My relationship with food is pretty

unhealthy most of the time. However, when I do practice healthy eating habits, I notice

how much better I feel and how much more energy I have. So, I continue to work

diligently at improving my overall health with diet and exercise. I also include vitamins

and supplements to help regulation of my body and mind.

Physical health plays a crucial role in supporting mental health and recovery. Two key

components are:

 Eating Healthy: A balanced diet provides essential nutrients that boost brain

function, stabilize mood, and improve energy levels. Consuming whole foods,

such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, supports overall well-

being and reduces the risk of emotional instability.

 Regular Exercise: Physical activity releases endorphins, the body’s natural

mood elevators. Exercise helps reduce stress, improve sleep, and enhance self-

esteem. Activities like walking, yoga, or strength training can be tailored to

individual fitness levels and preferences.

Self-Care Techniques: Prioritizing Your Well-Being

Ok guys this one is SO important! Self-care. As a full-time Peer Recovery Support

Specialist and single mom it is so difficult to find time for my self-care routine. Honestly,

it requires a level of discipline to ensure that you actually make time for yourself

throughout the busy week. Early in my recovery my self-care was small. I treated myself

to a manicure and pedicure once a month. As time went on and I rediscovered other

things that I enjoy doing my self-care got easier and I realized it didn’t have to cost me

any money. A walk with my headphones in and music playing. A kayaking trip on a quiet

lake. A bubble bath with some candles and a book. These are all simple ways I practice

my self-care routine.

Self-care is essential for maintaining balance and well-being during recovery. By

dedicating time to self-care, individuals can nurture their mental, emotional, and

physical health. Some effective self-care techniques include:

 Creating a Routine: Establishing a daily routine provides structure and stability,

reducing feelings of chaos or overwhelm.

 Setting Boundaries: Learning to say no and protecting personal time ensures

that energy is preserved for meaningful activities and relationships.

 Engaging in Hobbies: Pursuing interests and creative outlets, such as art,

music, or gardening, fosters joy and self-expression.

 Practicing Relaxation: Activities like taking a warm bath, reading a book, or

enjoying nature help reduce stress and promote inner peace.



 Incorporating Positive Affirmations: Reciting positive affirmations daily builds

confidence and shifts focus toward optimism and hope.

Focusing on Balance in Your Life

Balance in your life is the ever-elusive goal for everyone. Early in my recovery process

when I was court ordered to complete IOP (intensive outpatient program), they drilled

the balance wheel into our heads. I hated that wheel! Because who can achieve

balance in their lives? It seemed like an unattainable goal, even for someone not facing

the barriers of addiction recovery. Here is what I have learned. It may not be attainable.

The purpose is to remain aware of it and check in on where you are. It’s simply a tool to

see where you are focusing most of your energy and where you need to focus some

more energy.

Achieving and maintaining balance is a cornerstone of successful recovery. Balance

involves:

 Work-Life Harmony: Avoid overloading on work or recovery activities while

neglecting leisure or relationships.

 Emotional Equilibrium: Strive to balance challenging emotions with positive

experiences and coping tools.

 Time Management: Allocate time for self-care, responsibilities, and relaxation to

prevent burnout and enhance overall well-being.

Using the Balance Wheel of Life in Recovery

The Balance Wheel of Life is a visual tool designed to help individuals evaluate

and improve different areas of their life, ensuring they are balanced and well-

rounded. This tool is particularly effective in recovery as it encourages individuals

to focus on various aspects of their lives rather than solely their recovery journey.

The wheel typically includes categories such as:

1. Physical Health: Fitness, diet, and overall well-being.

2. Emotional Well-being: Mental health, emotional regulation, and mindfulness.

3. Relationships: Family, friendships, and social connections.

4. Career/Work: Job satisfaction, purpose, and professional growth.

5. Spiritual Growth: Sense of purpose, spirituality, or connection with something

greater.

6. Finances: Stability, budgeting, and financial goals.

7. Recreation/Fun: Leisure activities and hobbies.

8. Personal Growth: Education, self-improvement, and skill development.



Steps to Use the Balance Wheel:

 Self-Assessment: Rate each area on a scale of 1-10 based on satisfaction or

fulfillment. This creates a visual representation of where balance may be lacking.

 Set Goals: Focus on areas with lower scores and set achievable goals to

improve them. For example, if emotional well-being is low, prioritize therapy or

mindfulness practices.

 Monitor Progress: Regularly revisit the wheel to evaluate changes and ensure

continued balance.

 Celebrate Achievements: Recognize improvements in any area, reinforcing

motivation and positivity.

Benefits of Balance:

 Prevents Burnout: Focusing solely on one area, such as work or recovery

activities, can lead to exhaustion. The wheel encourages diverse self-care.

 Improves Resilience: A balanced life helps individuals handle stress and

challenges without turning to substances.

 Fosters Joy: Prioritizing recreation and relationships nurtures happiness and

fulfillment, essential for long-term recovery.



Building a Holistic Recovery Plan

I like outlines. I feel like when you have an outline to stick to it makes the steps to reach

your goals clear and attainable. Building a holistic recovery plan can help you stay on

track and take back your life. You are not “winging” it. You are following an outline that

you have created and personalized to your life and situation. I’m not saying if you follow

the plan there will not be missteps, but at least you know how to regroup and start again

if you are following your outline.

Mental health and wellness are most effective when integrated into a holistic recovery

plan. This plan may include:

1. Physical Health: Regular exercise and a nutritious diet support mental clarity

and emotional stability.

2. Social Support: Connecting with loved ones, mentors, and recovery groups

strengthens emotional support networks.

3. Spiritual Growth: Practices like yoga, meditation, or attending spiritual

gatherings nurture a sense of purpose and connection.



4. Self-Care and Balance: Prioritizing self-care and maintaining balance ensures

sustained progress and resilience.

5. Mindfulness and Journaling: Incorporating tools like mindfulness cards,

affirmation cards, and journaling promotes ongoing self-reflection and positive

growth.

6. Gratitude Lists: Regularly writing gratitude lists reinforces a positive perspective

and fosters appreciation for the progress made.



Final Thoughts

The journey to a lifestyle of recovery is challenging. There are many barriers to

overcome your past and learn to live in the present. It is a never-ending road, but there

is strength in resilience, and if nothing else addicts are resilient. I don’t have it all figured

out. I have good days and bad days like anyone else, but I wanted to share the vital

tools that have gotten me this far and continue to get me through. I’ve learned that

recovery from substance use disorder is a journey of transformation. It requires

commitment to mental health and wellness. By embracing practices like mindfulness,

EMDR therapy, regular and group therapy, mental health check-ins, eating healthy,

regular exercise, self-care techniques, and a focus on balance, we can heal deeply and

build a life of stability and joy. Remember, recovery is not just about overcoming the

past—it’s about creating a hopeful and fulfilling future.

1jm9ydt,Addiction,1743207838.0,"What 40 Years of life Taught Me: Understanding the Mental, Physical, and Hormonal Triad of Balance I have spent years trying to find out what makes me tick, what thrills me, excites me, and how to prevent that excitement from turning into anxiety. Finding coping mechanisms for my ADHD and deal with anxiety and—at times—depression. Constantly changing mental states, motivation, energy levels, and other factors that keep throwing me off balance have been a really big challenge—one that has led me to stay addicted to certain substances or habits for extended periods. There have been good times, where I managed to stay motivated and sober for months and even over a year and a half at one point, but relapses are always around the corner.

On my journey to finding that sacred equilibrium that leads to a life worth living, I’ve come across so many bits of knowledge, and I’ve assembled them into an eclectic (perhaps pseudo-scientific or non-scientific) belief—one that helps me battle on and hopefully find my peace or a balanced form of chaos that makes my glass half full instead of half empty. I am absolutely not a scientist, but I have read a lot about the sciences of the topics I will discuss. There will be mistakes along the way, but I believe that my interpretation and main goal are a shot in the right direction. I hope I can offer those who read this a shortcut or a guide on how to manage their problems without having to go through the years and years of challenges I have gone through. That would make it worthwhile for me—because then at least my misery will have served for something greater.

# The Myth of the Silver Bullet

I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, all with their own one-stop-shop solutions to ‘how to get your life back on track’ or ‘how to be successful’. They often promise that if you do this one thing or make just a couple of these small changes, your life will change for sure. Dozens of commenters acknowledge how their lives actually changed and how the miracle lessons have miraculously healed them. The problem with these comments is, of course—survivor bias. Even if there are thousands of comments stating their lives have changed, this is still a very small percentage if there are millions of views, and those were just the lucky few whose specific problem was addressed by this particular solution. But that doesn’t mean that the majority of people will heal with this quick-fix, one-trick-pony remedy. Meanwhile, those who didn’t solve their problems have already continued their journey in misery to find the next big thing that can potentially heal them—and are too exhausted to leave negative feedback. This is not to say that the advice given on many of the topics in self-help media isn't helpful—it usually is—but there is rarely a singular solution to a comorbid problem.

# Wounds You Can't Bandage

It’s not easy dealing with mental problems because they involve much more of our ego than physical problems do—at least for me. When your leg is broken and you cannot walk, you can learn to live with that; it can be remedied and it will likely heal. It can hurt, and maybe you broke your leg doing something stupid, but then you’re already bringing the physical pain to a mental level. Physical problems can be challenging, but they can usually be dealt with in a practical way; however, mental problems are much harder to grasp. You cannot patch them up with a band-aid, you cannot supplement them or binge or gamble them away—even though we try doing so a lot. Addictions are usually band-aids on mental wounds that require surgery instead.

Mental problems are tied to our ego, which makes them much harder to deal with, because if something is wrong with your body, there is either something you can do or nothing you can do at all. But with mental problems, there is a big sense of guilt; it’s not your body that is flawed in that case, but it’s you, as a person, your ego, everything that you are—your entire existence, reasoning, and character—it is all flawed, at least this is the perception. Have you ever noticed that almost every self-help podcast or video is about solving problems that require a physical action, like meditating, going to the gym, eating a certain way, or taking a supplement? There are barely any self-help guides telling you that you need to go get serious cognitive therapy—because that’s a problem they cannot help you with. There are a few so-called systems that tell you how you should deal with certain situations and apply some kind of abbreviation or initialism that will help you in those moments—Three G’s, 5 B's, twelve T’s, whatever. They can help, but they won’t stick, because they don’t treat the problem; they don’t even patch the wound like a supplement could; they simply distract you whenever you run into another wall.

Mental problems can sometimes be fixed by physical solutions, but in most cases—when we have a history of chronic mental issues—the problem cannot be treated by just a singular solution, but it requires a multilateral approach. So is therapy the solution then? Again, a singular solution that will not fix a multitude of problems. More on this later.

# Chasing Physical Solutions

I didn’t like to accept that my problems stemmed from mental issues for a long time, so I have looked for dozens if not hundreds of ways to solve my problems physically. I’ve tried supplements, excessive workout routines, a keto diet, losing weight, cutting alcohol—and probably a whole lot more. Often, I initially thought I had finally found the solution and I started feeling better—probably due to the placebo effect—but after a while, I returned to my old miserable self and relapsed into whatever state I was in before my newfound miracle solution.

Some things worked better than others; for instance, actually going to the gym 5 or 6 times a week helped a lot, but eventually, I had an injury—and that ended my excessive gym period for the next year or so. What was also very confusing to me was that at times I felt worse when I was living my healthiest life as opposed to when I was an alcoholic and I felt fine mentally—but physically I was in a terrible state. The mind has the ability to push your body past its limits and far beyond—I’ve experienced this during times when I was highly motivated and required barely any sleep for days, even weeks. Eventually, the lack of sleep and unhealthy lifestyle catches up and you pay the price. This is where the key to all of this comes in...

# The Chemical Rollercoaster

There are a lot of hormones that make us who we are on a daily basis. Serotonin, Dopamine, Cortisol, Oxytocin, and Epinephrine are several main contributors to how we feel and act every day. We all know oxygen is important, and we can find out really quickly by holding our breath; you’ll be reminded of how much we need it within just seconds. We also know very well what the importance of food is; try not eating for a while and we grow hungry. We all recognize these deficits very easily and very acutely, but with hormones it is very tricky—they’re not so easy to identify, and they blend into one big soup in your brain making you the person you are.

A lack of dopamine can make you demotivated; a lack of adrenaline, lacking in energy; a lack of serotonin, depressed. Even though you are not aware of it—like with food and oxygen—your behaviour changes when your hormones are not at the levels your brain likes them to be. So if your dopamine and adrenaline (epinephrine) levels are low, you are more likely to engage in risky behaviour—like gambling or extreme sports—that will give you a quick rush and reward you with the sweet dopamine and adrenaline hormones your brain craves. Your mind is more intuitive than you might think. There have been reports of children putting metal objects into their mouth because they had iron deficiencies and no one was aware of it; their brain just signaled them to lick that shiny metal object because their iron was running low. Things may seem random at times, but most of the time they are not random at all—that sudden craving my daughter had for yoghurt, while she rarely ate it. Turns out she was running low on protein because she doesn’t like meat.

There is a problem with short-term rewards that induce much-needed dopamine, epinephrine, or other deficit hormones. They cause spikes and crashes and in turn set you up for a lifetime of roller-coaster hormone management. Then there is downregulation and upregulation of hormones. When you spike a hormone for an extended period of time, your brain will down- or upregulate them, making you more or less sensitive to them. This means that if you start gambling, at first a small bet will give you the required amount of hormones you are seeking, but over time, you will need more of it—and it needs to get more extreme, too—because you are becoming insensitive to that specific hormone. This is your brain’s way to deal with a flood of hormones. Last but not least, for those of us with ADHD or other neurodivergent disorders, the brain is running low or is insensitive to certain hormones by default—making us want them more than the neurotypical person—and that is a reason why so many people with ADHD are sensitive to addiction.

If you want to get your life on track, you will need to balance your hormones and even more so, you need to do it in a healthy and sustainable way. You will need to replace the bad habits with healthy ones, perhaps take medication and supplements. But as mentioned before, physical solutions are not a solution to a comorbid problem; even if you manage to get your hormones stable and steady, you have to guide yourself through a mental minefield to not relapse and create a hormonal tsunami. Your hormones right now control how you feel, but managing your hormones will control how you will feel tomorrow. Hence it’s important not to go for short-term gains, but to build upon long-term rewards—rewards that will help you feel good all the time. The big trap I have found here is that eventually it’s your deep-rooted mental problems that can throw things off balance again.

# Foundational Pillars (But Not the Whole House)

Keeping hormones in check involves a lot of physical action. Three pillars of a balanced life are sleep, nutrition, and exercise. These three will get you a long way towards living a better life. Get enough sleep, avoid refined sugar (short-chain carbohydrates), and exercise 2-3 times a week. This is something that is commonly agreed on to be a good way to live.

However, if you’re mentally in a bad place and your hormones are all over the place, it seems much harder to keep these pillars up. But if you want a chance and you have to start somewhere—start there. Perhaps you need some medication or supplements, perhaps you need to meditate or take an ice bath—these are things you will need to figure out for yourself and maybe then, you can get a handle on things. But eventually, you will need to confront the demons inside your head—the patterns that always bring you back to where you were. Having a healthy lifestyle alone does not guarantee feeling good even when all the hormones are at optimal levels. Your self-sabotaging ego will eventually bring you back to the state prior to your newfound equilibrium.

# Fueling the Brain: The Gut-Brain Connection

Yes, I know this sounds like every health podcaster out there, but hear me out: the gut-brain axis is extremely important. A healthy gut means a healthy brain, and if you do want to get those hormones in check, eating the right things cannot be underestimated. It also means that you don’t have to rely on supplements most of the time. But if you really want to eat healthy, this has to become another thing to dive into—because modern Western society has a grievously terrible food industry that does not care about human health at all.

My no-brainer advice on food is simple: don’t eat refined sugars—none at all. All other things like salt, fat, meat, dairy, etc., are a much too complicated and nuanced topic to devote to in this writing. Food has the single biggest impact on our health and hormones on a daily basis—and it should not be underestimated. When I was on a keto diet, my day-to-day life changed completely, and I still look back with envy of that time. But the keto diet is very hard to maintain and lacks much-needed scientific research—especially for long-term health benefits or risks. For mental stability, however, keto is surging as treatment that might be used in ADHD therapy. It helped me wake up energized in the morning, kept my energy levels consistent, and reduced my ADHD symptoms, but eventually—I got very depressed and decided to take a break. I am not sure keto was the cause of it; it could have also been winter depression or a dozen other things. But once I started eating carbs, my depression instantly disappeared. The mistake I might have made here is that I linked not eating carbs to getting depressed, but having gone for a couple of months without carbs and then eating them again can very well create a ginormous short-term hormonal tsunami of pleasure—because the brain loves carbs and I just handed it its favourite quick-fix fuel source. After a week or two back on carbs, I stopped noticing the positive effects and went back to being depressed—and that is when I relapsed into alcohol and then gambling. It is a slippery slope; one domino falls and they all fall.

Do not underestimate how much food can influence behaviour—especially at a young age. There are hundreds of thousands of kids that are being misdiagnosed with ADHD simply due to having a very bad diet at home and in school, filled with processed foods and non-complex carbohydrates, which—especially for a developing brain and body that is already abundant in energy—can supercharge them, making them go hyperactive.

# The Comfort of Chaos: Confronting Self-Sabotage

I’ve felt great mentally while treating my body like garbage, and I’ve felt terrible living as healthy as I can—in complete abstinence from any addiction. The problem is not just hormones, not just living healthy or unhealthy, but a combination of things. Living a relatively calm life is confusing for me. Having ADHD, living a balanced life means I probably run a deficit on dopamine—and keeping myself from getting what the brain needs sets me up for failure eventually.

But that is not all. The biggest problem might actually be the fact that the brain tries to stick to what it knows—it likes to live in a recognizable pattern and it fears the unknown. Being miserable and living a chaotic lifestyle means I’ve gotten used to it; my brain has actually grown accustomed to being in a state of misery and it likes to stay there. So whenever things are going well and I am actually gearing up for success, the brakes are pulled and I start self-sabotaging hard. I might overdo my exercises in the gym—subconsciously creating injury; I might relapse into a binge-gambling session even though there was absolutely no need for it—and I even had all my hormones at the perfect levels. My self-sabotaging nature is the final frontier, preventing me from finally getting to the goal I have been chasing all my life—something I have managed to touch several times but was never able to hold on to: being genuinely happy and even more so accepting that happiness.

You can live as healthy as you can, you can have the perfect balance, you can manage to swap out your bad habits for healthy ones, your short-term rewards for long-term rewards, you can eat, sleep, and exercise all you want—and still manage to ruin it all. And that is why it’s not a proper lifestyle or perfect hormonal health that will get you your life back, but serious cognitive therapy—possibly with the right medication, and optimally with all the aforementioned pillars of stability.

# Mind Over Matter

There were people living in terrible physical conditions in concentration camps during WWII; they managed to push themselves beyond what is deemed physically possible. Most gave up or were simply pushed beyond what the human body can sustain—but only those who were mentally able to overcome the insurmountable obstacles were able to survive the physical pain. And these prisoners, I can assure you, did not have their hormones at optimal levels—not at all. It’s the mind that carries the body, not the other way around.

However, the triad of the cognitive mind, the physical body, and the hormonal balance determine if you are going to achieve happiness and balance or not—with the cognitive mind running the show. Keep in mind, without a healthy body or with hormones out of control, it is inevitable that eventually you will succumb to trouble; it will just take a bit longer, because the body can tolerate a lot—but the ego is much more fragile.

# What now?

Focus on your mental health—make it your biggest priority. Your surroundings matter; the people around you can either lift you up or bring you down. Your gambling or drinking buddies may not be the best people for you to hang around with. Maybe you need to cut the rope and end your abusive relationship. We often stay in relationships because getting out of them means drastic change and a lot of unknowns—but staying in toxic environments will keep us constantly self-sabotaging.

Personally, I think I self-sabotaged in my previous relationship because I had to somehow justify my abusive ex’s behaviour—and if I gambled away my money, I could put myself on the same level as her. She did bad things, but hey, I gambled, so I was just as bad. There was no way I could allow myself to be in an abusive relationship if I had to acknowledge that I was a good guy myself.

Many gamblers acknowledge that gambling is not about money, and I believe that’s true—even more so, gambling can be a symptom. Maybe you’re in a bad relationship, maybe you’ve got a trauma, or perhaps gambling is your way of self-sabotaging—because you believe you don’t deserve to be happy and it’s your brain afraid to get out of that familiar state of misery. Gambling can also just be that hormone deficit, and the rush or thrill gives you the boost you need. But if that is the case, then you are in luck, because this is the easiest form of addiction to beat in my perspective—because you can simply replace gambling with something much healthier. Personally, I am not addicted to gambling; I am addicted to being addicted to at least one thing that makes my dopamine flow.

# You Don't Have to Go It Alone

You don’t have to do this alone; there are a lot of professionals willing to help you and guide you on your way to a better life. Don’t try to cheat your way out of it by finding happiness in self-help stuff online; they usually don’t work or take up all your time finding the right one—running the risk that for every single method that fails, it will make you feel more and more miserable.

Having said that, even cognitive therapy is not a 100% guarantee—and it also requires trial and error and a lot of effort. You have to really want it. A big problem with self-help and trusting algorithms with finding out what your problem is, is that you are self-diagnosing—and self-diagnosing is one of the worst things you can do. If you get professional help, objective professionals will diagnose you, and the likelihood of them finding out what is actually wrong is much higher. Sometimes putting your trust in others can be a very good thing—even when people around you have damaged you and your trust.

# Mastering the Basics: Sleep, Nutrition, Exercise

Get enough sleep, eat healthy, and do some actual research into what good nutrition means—but be on the lookout for misinformation. Food science is a very grey area, and even the research can be unreliable because a lot of research out there is funded by malicious actors in the food industry. Try to exercise regularly; it doesn’t have to be very intense. Just taking a walk, taking a swim, or riding a bicycle can be a good start. But also don’t overdo it; running more than 15 kilometers per day is said to actually be damaging for your heart.

*Sidenote: I seem to make some absolute statements about physical needs, but everyone is different and may have different sleep, nutrition, and exercise needs. Keep track of what works for you and make changes accordingly.*

# Aiming for Steady State: Sustainable Hormone Balance

Don’t get tempted to go for quick-fixes; try to go for long-term rewards. Avoid situations and people that tempt you into bad habits. Don’t fight your hormonal needs, but swap out the bad habits for healthy ones. Remind yourself that spiking a hormone or depleting it will have consequences that can last days, weeks—or even linger for months.

# Failure as Feedback: The Art of Bouncing Back

Don’t be discouraged when you slip up or fail at first—or for the 34th time. Learn from your mistakes and try to do them differently the next time; allow yourself to be imperfect. Most very successful people we know were serial failures until they finally managed to succeed—the difference is they didn’t give up until they made it. That doesn’t mean you should make the same mistake over and over again; that, according to Einstein, is the definition of insanity. (Yes, I know he was talking about solving math problems, not human behaviour.)

# Final Thoughts

The thought that keeps coming back—and something that I stand behind completely—is that no books, therapy, supplement, lifestyle, or whatever will get you to quit addiction; neither will my writing. The only way to take the step out of the spiraling downward circle is if you have suffered enough—and you simply cannot suffer this way any longer. Whatever you will find at the moment your suffering has become too great will be the thing that helps you recover from any and hopefully all of your addictions.

Be sure that the solution is sustainable and be aware of traps and self-sabotage. Many addicts have to try several times before being successful, and when their abstinence is longer than several weeks, the relapses are almost always self-sabotage or other cognitive patterns—because the body has adapted to a lifestyle without addiction after a few weeks or months, but the mind can take years, and if left unattended, it will turn on you within a heartbeat.

Don’t listen to every silly thing your mind tells you. You are not your thoughts—they tend to be inaccurate and noisy.

1jm9msp,Addiction,1743206866.0,"Epiphany during a relapse? Before getting sober, I used every day. Both alone and with others. It was just my normal, and quitting meant completely changing how I lived my life. I was sober for 5 months, then relapsed. After that, I made it another 5 months and relapsed again. I didn’t plan it this way, but it’s strange that both times, I made it to the same point before slipping. Has anyone else experienced relapsing at a similar streak length?

This time, it wasn’t even that I expected it to feel good.. I didn’t really expect anything. I was just feeling really lonely being sober and ended up hanging out with people from before, which led to the relapse. The weird thing is, I could have had the epiphany before it even happened because the experience itself had nothing to do with it. It feels like my mind can only reach those realizations while being on the drug, which makes me question if the epiphany is even real. But at the same time, it feels healthy, like I finally understand things I need to understand to actually stay sober. 

For example, when I’m sober, I romanticize using and feel like my sober life is empty. But when I relapse, I realize I actually love my sober life way more. It’s like my brain is playing both sides, and I don’t know how to hold onto the clarity I have right now.

It’s not that I forget why I quit.. I know how bad it was. But when I’m sober, I start feeling like it isn’t worth it because the loneliness is worse than being an addict. That’s what keeps pulling me back.

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you deal with the loneliness without convincing yourself that going back is the better option?

My husband recently had a surgery and got sepsis in his big toe and has given up all hope. Ordered a whole bunch of drugs off the dark web to our house, and continue to do all of them in a span of three days. He has lost control of his bowels. He has lost most motor function and motor skills. All he does is take oxy and nod off. The other day he did more than 10 g of ketamine and I found him on the floor nonresponsive. I continued to call the ambulance and when I called all they did was pump his stomach and sent him home. Meanwhile, I’m getting begged for more drugs and getting told that he needs drugs to survive almost to the point where he’s crying. Six or seven months ago, he had a seizure and broke his shoulder and had to have a surgery on his shoulder. With that said last night, he told me that I should’ve let him die from the seizure. He has told me more than once that he would like to die. No amount of support or his mom hiding things from him is enough. I’m scared by my birthday in June that I will be a widow.

I find it hard to call myself that without feeling all “oh! woe is me”, but like.. for the past 3 years I have felt like I needed some type of drug to just to get through my day to day life. My drug of choice has changed a few times, but the most important thing to me was just *not* being sober. Drugs became the only thing that could make me actually get up. Like if I was out, the only thing I was able to make myself do was.. go get more. If not that I was bedrotting. 

My partner (we’ll call Y) is a recovering actual addict. They were doing drugs for way longer than me, and way harder drugs too. I know you really can’t compare your insides to others insides to see if you are valid, but I hard not to. They go to AA and NA meetings multiple times a week, and is currently more than 100 days sober, which ik is still fresh, but longer than I’ve ever gone. Since we started living together I have been trying to get sober, a lot because I know I can’t be doing drugs while living with a recovering addict (that would never end well). I did try a little bit to get off xanax before meeting them, but it never worked. 

I go with them to AA and NA sometimes and just feel so out of place. I don’t feel like I am “addict enough” to be there. I am 18 and have only been using drugs regularly for like 3 years. 

I feel like a fraud in my “addiction”, and at the same time like a fraud in my sobriety. 

Every time I know I am going to be away from Y for more than a few hours my brain is like “DO DRUGS NOW”. I try to have some fucking self control but almost always end up caving and if I have to do something even remotely stressful by myself Im all the way cooked, like no shot. I haven’t thrown away any of my stash cuz I’m scared, but like am I even really trying to be sober at that point? Do I even want to get better?

And now I’m just questioning my original intention and reason for attempting to be sober. I don’t think I’m trying to get sober for the right reasons. Or if I will ever be able to actually stay sober if I go into it with my current mindset.

Soo basically I don’t really give a fuck what happens to me. Like, I wouldn’t say I *hate* myself, it’s more like I don’t believe I really matter or have value..💀 (That sounds so depresso espresso, but c’est la vie) 
For a bit I though I might’ve actually wanted to get sober for me as well as them, but after I was (technically) raped (according to Y) during a big xan and speed relapse (couldn’t consent cuz I was blacked tf out) and the only thing I was worried about was if I had hurt or disappointed Y by relapsing (and the man, but mostly relapsing cuz we weren’t official then) I realised.. bitch, I’m not doing this for me at all.
So like why would I care if I fuck my brain up with drugs, get raped, or fucking die? Like idk!! The only thing that matters to me is that I don’t hurt THEM. The main reason I’m trying to stay sober is so that I can be good for my partner and not trigger them. The last thing I would ever want is to make them relapse. So basically I think the reason why I keep relapsing when I’m alone is cuz my brain is telling me it doesn’t matter cuz Y isn’t here to get triggered..

I feel like I’m faking being sober, even though I don’t mean to lose control and relapse, I just don’t know how to stop myself when I’m alone because, like I said, I see no reason to. I don’t do it for me. Which makes me feel like me trying to be sober at this point in my life is just useless. I believe that if you go into things like sobriety/recovery with the wrong intention, it’s just not gonna work. And that makes me think… If I’m not going to be able to stay sober I really shouldn’t be with my partner, because 1. It could so easily fuck with their sobriety and recovery if they knew about it and 2. I never know how to tell them about my relapses cuz I know they would be disappointed, but the last thing I want is to have this relationship be built on secrets and lies.. 

So I’m like… what do I do? 
Is there a way to change my view on sobriety, myself, addiction, all of that stuff.. do I have to end it and move out? I don’t know. Please I just need advice generally, or like what would you do? Or just anything, I feel so alone. I think Y is the only person I know who would get it, but I don’t know what to tell them.. 

Sorry this was so extremely long,, but help pls 😔

1jm10l3,Addiction,1743184128.0,"I got sober and got into my dream college ❤️‍🩹 This is my story and I think it's worth telling, I also want someone to be excited with me. I don't have many people to tell about this. I have achieved so much so this is how l'm gonna celebrate, by telling my story. As well as I hope it inspires others who have been or are in my situation.
Trigger Warning: This story discusses assault, PTSD, addiction, and suicidal thoughts.
Three years ago, I was starting freshman year in highschool. I was a young happy girl who liked spending time with friends. I enjoyed music and preforming in my highschools drama class. And then my life changed forever.
I was brutally attacked, and in an instant, I went from being a happy, carefree kid to feeling completely worthless, alone, and lost in depression. I struggled with PTSD, nightmares and flash backs, but for a long time, I refused to seek help. Instead, I turned to substances. I smoked weed, used nicotine, and
experimented with other things to escape the pain. They at the time were the only thing that actually provided any relief for me. And I became heavily addicted.

Eventually, my parents caught on-but only after I hit rock bottom. They intervened when I attempted to take my own life. After that, I transferred to online school, hoping for a fresh start. But my reputation followed me. I had become someone I barely recognized - constantly under the influence and seeking validation in all the wrong places.
At some point, though, something changed. I started watching inspirational videos, desperately wanting to feel good about myself again. Slowly, I began to believe that I could take back control of my life. So, I made a decision: I was going to get sober.
It wasn't easy. I relapsed several times and had to cut off people who weren't good for me. But after months of trying-really trying—| did it. I got clean. It felt like I had accomplished the impossible. Though I still get cravings and impulses to relapse, I am currently over two years sober. After this time I met my now boyfriend. Who has been nothing but an incredible support through my struggles, so he deserves a mention. I love him very much, and he's a very good man. He helped me feel safe, he encouraged me to get professional help, and stayed with me through my nightmares and struggles. He is genuinely the love of my life. And now we've been together just under two years.

During my junior year, still struggling with anxiety and depression, and ptsd, I focused on my mental health while attending online school. I was placed in an academic program where attendance was flexible, but due to a typo, l never received the email explaining how in the program you have to fill out very specific attendance forms. Because of this, I unknowingly racked up too many unexcused absences, and by the time I realized it, I had lost credit for an entire semester-eight full classes. I was devastated.
It felt like my future had slipped through my fingers. It was going to be very difficult to graduate let alone get into any good college. I felt very defeated.
When my family moved, I decided to return to public school for my senior year, even though I seriously considered dropping out. I was starting with a 1.7 GPA-a number so low it felt impossible to recover from. But going back to public school was the best decision I could have made. I got a fresh start, made incredible friends, started working part-time, and, most importantly, I got help. I began therapy, got on proper medication for my PTSD, and finally found the courage to speak up about my attack.

When I met with my academic advisor, she told me she had never seen a student retake this many credits or raise this low of a GPA high enough to get into college. But she also told me something that stuck with me—if I was dedicated enough, she believed I could do it.
So, we made a plan.
For weeks on end, I stayed after school to retake classes and complete assignments. This semester, I took 12 classes. My schedule was brutal. I woke up at 7 AM for school, stayed until 3:30 PM, went straight to work at 4:15 PM, and didn't get home until 11:30 PM. Sleep was a luxury I couldn't afford. But I pushed through. I worked harder than I ever had before. And somehow, I did it. My grades soared—| was getting A's and B's across the board.
Then, today happened.

I was sitting in third period, finishing an assignment when I decided to check my email.
I wasn't expecting much-maybe a generic response from one of the colleges I applied to.
But then, I saw it.
An email from my dream school. My #1 choice.
I was freaking out when I opened it expecting to read a polite rejection or a simple ""Thank you for applying."" But instead, I saw a word I never thought l'd see:
""Congratulations!""
I had to fight back tears.
It took three-almost four-years, but I made it.
I survived. I fought through every setback, every dark moment, every doubt. And now, not only am I graduating, but I'm going to my dream college.
For the first time in a long time, I realize just how strong I am.
If you've made it this far, thank you for listening to my story. I feel so blessed and proud of how far l've come, and I wanted to share this moment with you.

Please remember this: You are so much stronger than you realize. Even when it doesn't feel like it, you are doing an incredible job.
Keep pushing forward. It really does get better.
Just take it one step at a time and give yourself the grace and space you need to grow and heal. Thank you for reading, I am so excited to go to college and graduate. Just know you can absolutely do it. Getting sober, and overcoming your struggles are so worth it. Life isn’t perfect, I still struggle with ptsd, and cravings. But I’ve learned how beautiful the world really is, and I’m so happy and fulfilled. You can do this, I promise.

1jlxf5v,Addiction,1743174918.0,"2 weeks or so as I started ""serious"" recording of my sobriety progress... cravings again Dear all,

This is my entry to the discussion of the progress. Or ranting, to a large extent.

Because it's been since I got really drunk, high on coke (again) until Monday 10AM. Maybe, my drinking etc. worsened due to my ex-wife leaving due to: alcoholism/addiction, me wanting to fuck other girls, her not living comfortably in abroad (since no job for her, and only because of me).

I mean, the whole chain of events and the whole story is (like always) very intertwined, and difficult to conceptualize? To some extent. Well, at least with alcohol it was ever since my mother passed of cancer 10 years ago (29M now). And drugs, they were on and off, but recently - quite on (maybe since after Covid started).

And now, to the work part. So after this 10th of March, I decided to seriously stop it. It is very easy to proclaim especially in the first-second day. Like, ""it is boring"", and in fact, there is nothing fun about getting drunk and then high, and then feeling that only for 1-2 hours, and then just feeling like it really is nonsensical. But days come, you feel the routine, stress, etc., etc., and start feeling like ""ok, 3 day, feels easy..."", then ""4 day"" (which is today).

So exactly today, I feel, like it started to get worse. It was even from yesterday, but today - especially.

So, yesterday and today I started doing my work, ok, I do it relatively fine, but I feel like I am lacking and underperforming potentially. Ok, today I had a more vivid dreaming (I notice that it's because of my sleep was actually fucked up without me noticing it).

Then, after around 2.5 hours (I work from home, quite relaxed, flexible schedule, but still needs to be done) I found a sort of depression ongoing? Like, I see the sunny weather outside, and I just notice that I have the money, I don't need to pressurize myself, and I started feeling........ Like, it goes on and on, sometimes mixes, along the following lines:

\- I can relax, so maybe?

\- It is not very healthy, it is boring

\- I can not have a drink or anything, as it will lead to a binge drinking series and again, reset the time, while I want to get rid off it

\- Why the fuck do I have to suffer this craving?

\- I am not that special not to have the cravings - it is the consequence of my actions.

\- Maybe just one?

\- \[Not a thought, but a feeling: Dull absence of joy in life and a desire to go out for some\]

So, I was just lying in there, hoping for this to get over. But it did not get to the 2nd day motivation ""drinking is boring, fuck drinking!""

It was like: ""I sort of need this shit to feel somewhat fine again! I know I can't get it, but I also fucking want it, and I can't do anything about wanting not to want that!""

I mean, it was not a very novel thought to me, I noticed this when I did the same attempt and had a relapse on saturday (when I went abroad to work, I just felt that I was feeling grumpy, annoyed, stressed, and I had a week ahead of me of work, so I felt like ""I needed a drink to get by, as I can't afford not to work properly."" So, then it went to binge drinking, feeling alone and unwanted abroad, with my ex-wife gone, and there are all these foreign alien people to me, and so fuck it"" kind of process.

  
Why in the hell can you not stop it?

Because, I was thinking (before) that ""ok, but this is what I want, not that SOMEONE ELSE wants"". So, once I try to stop, this was a surprise? Like ""Ok, now I don't want to do it, but why the fuck is it that I still actually want to do it?""

I mean, ex-wife and me we also tried to stop it. However, on around 10th day or so I felt this depression like ""fuck everything, I don't want to move"" and so even when travelling, even on her birthday parties, I was like ""I can't move, help plz"", like feeling stuck. Then, we had big arguments: she felt like I spoiled her birthday and fair enough, but it was also that I couldn't have done shit? I don't know, or maybe I could have?

So, this is all just so much fucking material to write and write and write and write and write and write and write and write and write............. Like, one thing leads to the next, and there is never a clear enough answer to how should I do it? Like, I want to feel the same feeling that I feel of joy when I am drunk/cocained, but while sober. And I am 100% sure that it is possible. But I don't feel it?

And so, I am just fucking stuck here. Like, it is so depressive on its own, feeling stuck.

And maybe, it's a good thing, feeling stuck? It means that I can't go backward (meaning, that there is just boredom and really no ""caif""). Though, I also can't go forward fast enough: like, the time just collapsed in on me: I was doing work, then I started feeling the craving, and so I started thinking, and thinking, etc.

And so I couldn't even have done the work?..

Fucking hell..

1jlqo0i,Addiction,1743152005.0,"When Addiction Becomes a Family Disease Addiction isn’t just self-destruction, it’s a bomb that goes off in the middle of a family, leaving behind collateral damage that never fully heals. My brother-in-law is an alcoholic, and for years, I’ve watched as his addiction consumed everything in its path. He is 37 years old and lives with his parents, leeches on them, emotionally, physically and financially. He lost his job months ago and he shows no desire to make anything of his life.

I have tried to distance myself and reminded myself that his choices are not my responsibility. But addiction doesn’t work like that. It creeps into every part of life. It turns family gatherings into tense, exhausting ordeals. It replaces love with resentment. It forces people into impossible situations, where there are no good choices, only the ones that hurt the least.

I know that one day, when his parents are gone, he will have nowhere else to turn. And no matter how much I try to prepare myself for that reality, the weight of it feels unbearable.

 

The Consequences No One Wants to Talk About

Addiction is messy. It’s not just about the drinking, it’s about everything that comes with it.

•             He gets so drunk that he pees himself in his sleep.

•             He has been in multiple car accidents because he drives drunk.

•             He makes inappropriate, suggestive comments to women in public.

•             He sexually harasses my best friend every time he sees her.

Last night was supposed to be special. We planned a birthday dinner for my mother-in-law’s 60th, a moment to celebrate her. He showed up already drunk and embarrassed us all by leering at women who wanted nothing to do with him.

This is what addiction does. It takes moments that should be joyful and stains them with shame and discomfort.

I used to feel anger. Now, mostly, I just feel tired.

 

What Addiction Does to a Marriage

My husband and I never expected this to be part of our life together. I know he struggles with it as much as I do. He loves his brother. I love my husband. And yet, that love does nothing to change the situation.

We fight about his brother, not because I don’t understand why things are the way they are, but because I see the future, and it terrifies me. When his parents are no longer here, what happens then? Where does that leave us?

I don’t want to resent my husband for his brother’s actions. I don’t want this to be a constant source of tension in our marriage. But I also can’t ignore the reality that, if nothing changes, the burden of his addiction will eventually land on us. And I don’t know how to make peace with that.

 

The Breaking Point

There are things I will never forgive my brother-in-law for.

In 2021, his father spent 11 months in the hospital, fighting for his life. He was on and off a ventilator, and we had to say goodbye more times than I can count. It was a year of grief, fear, and uncertainty.

My husband and I had just gotten married. A week after our wedding, we moved in with my mother-in-law to help her through the nightmare of nearly losing her husband. And then, out of nowhere, my brother-in-law moved in too.

He had been kicked out by his wife after sleeping with a prostitute. Instead of stepping up during the hardest time of his family’s life, he spiralled deeper into his addiction.

•             He went on endless drinking binges.

•             He got into accidents while driving drunk.

•             He was violent toward his own mother.

•             He verbally abused everyone around him.

There we were, trying to hold each other together, and instead of being a son, a brother, a human being, he became another source of pain, another problem no one knew how to solve.

 

The Unspoken Truth About Addiction in Families

People say, “You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.” But what they don’t say is what that means for the people left behind. The ones who have to live with the destruction. The ones who keep hoping, keep trying, keep getting disappointed.

I don’t have the luxury of pretending this doesn’t affect me. Every time he humiliates himself in public, every time he refuses to take responsibility for his life, every time I have to sit in silence while he makes people uncomfortable, it eats away at something inside me.

I wish I could walk away from it. I wish it didn’t weigh so heavily on my life, my marriage, my peace of mind. But addiction doesn’t give you that choice. It forces you to care, even when you don’t want to. It forces you to watch, even when it’s unbearable.

I don’t have answers. I don’t know how to fix this. I don’t know how to live with the knowledge that he will never change.

What I do know is that I can’t let his choices define my life. I can’t let my anger consume me. I can’t be the one who carries the weight of his addiction when he refuses to carry it himself.

One day, there will be a moment when I have to decide (when we all have to decide) how much more we are willing to sacrifice for someone who refuses to save himself.

And when that moment comes, I hope I have the strength to choose myself.",addiction becomes family disease addiction isnt selfdestruction bomb goes middle family leaving behind collateral damage never fully heals brotherinlaw alcoholic years ive watched addiction consumed everything path years old lives parents leeches emotionally physically financially lost job months ago shows desire make anything life tried distance reminded choices responsibility addiction doesnt work like creeps every part life turns family gatherings tense exhausting ordeals replaces love resentment forces people impossible situations good choices ones hurt least know one day parents gone nowhere else turn matter much try prepare reality weight feels unbearable consequences one wants talk addiction messy drinking everything comes gets drunk pees sleep multiple car accidents drives drunk makes inappropriate suggestive comments women public sexually harasses best friend every time sees last night supposed special planned birthday dinner motherinlaws th moment celebrate showed already drunk embarrassed us leering women wanted nothing addiction takes moments joyful stains shame discomfort used feel anger mostly feel tired addiction marriage husband never expected part life together know struggles much loves brother love husband yet love nothing change situation fight brother dont understand things way see future terrifies parents longer happens leave us dont want resent husband brothers actions dont want constant source tension marriage also cant ignore reality nothing changes burden addiction eventually land us dont know make peace breaking point things never forgive brotherinlaw father spent months hospital fighting life ventilator say goodbye times count year grief fear uncertainty husband gotten married week wedding moved motherinlaw help nightmare nearly losing husband nowhere brotherinlaw moved kicked wife sleeping prostitute instead stepping hardest time familys life spiralled deeper addiction went endless drinking binges got accidents driving drunk violent toward mother verbally abused everyone around trying hold together instead son brother human became another source pain another problem one knew solve unspoken truth addiction families people say cant help someone doesnt want helped dont say means people left behind ones live destruction ones keep hoping keep trying keep getting disappointed dont luxury pretending doesnt affect every time humiliates public every time refuses take responsibility life every time sit silence makes people uncomfortable eats away something inside wish could walk away wish didnt weigh heavily life marriage peace mind addiction doesnt give choice forces care even dont want forces watch even unbearable dont answers dont know fix dont know live knowledge never change know cant let choices define life cant let anger consume cant one carries weight addiction refuses carry one day moment decide decide much willing sacrifice someone refuses save moment comes hope strength choose,3,3,Negative,Moderate Concern
1jlpr5p,Addiction,1743147649.0,"19 years old SEVERE active drug addiction. My story. Might be a long one, just gonna type away. I’m really looking to vent/journal, but also need to get this off my chest.

So my mom was 19 when she had me and I believe my dad was in his mid-late 20s. They supposedly started off as a happy couple. Well that may have lasted a lil while but after about a year of having me they gave me over to my grandmother custody. Reason being my dad has a SEVERE drinking problem, and always has. He’s an angry, confrontational drunk, and supposedly a violent one at that. 

After a really bad argument between the 2 one night, my drunken dad came home to baby me crying, and my mom getting onto him so he  allegedly snapped and became violent. Don’t know all the details but I heard he got physical and beat hear and allegedly put a pistol to her head. In the past I’ve heard hes driven me home drunk when I was a child, crashed into a hospital cus he was drunk, etc etc. 

Found out my dad’s father, and his father, (so on so forth, are ALL alcoholics and hot headed angry people. So yeah, addiction definitely runs on dad’s side.  So like I said I was raised in early childhood by my grandmother (my nana) alone in a small suburban townhome. Dad was absent. Mom became a fucking stripper. I’ve had some issues since very early on in childhood. Started off as fine-motor skills, anger and focus issues and hyperactivity. So as you might’ve guessed I was diagnosed with ADHD around 6 years old. That was my first diagnosis.

In kindergarten through early grade school I was CONSTANTLY getting notes home or sent to the principals office for normal mischievous activity. When I would get home my grandma would get sooo upset, but never hit me or anything but make me feel super guilty and when my mom would find out she would come home and whoop my ass and yell at me. I’d say around 3rd grade is when my mental health first started declining. And it declined rapidly. 

I first remember having crippling anxiety around 8 or 9. It was ALWAYS worse in the morning. 

This lead to my troubles at school getting worse and worse, and by 6th grade I was getting suspended and getting detention. I mean ALOT. Like every few days. This would be for things like threatening people, anger outbursts, cursing ppl out etc. I was also picked on pretty bad around this time for being skinny and bc I had buck teeth. This happened all thru middle school, and was the worst in grade 7. Having this happen constantly DEPRIVED me of self-esteem and confidence. Around 6th grade I started noticing some depression symptoms, which grew rapidly and turned into constant suicidal ideation. I became suicidal, and grew resentful towards people and isolated. This turned into extreme depression and I became developing violent fantasies. I had few friends and no real hobbies or sports.

I had moved in with my mom and step-dad. He was ok at first, and always supported us majority financially, but his first anger outbursts started when I was 8. From grades 5-10 is when his anger was most prevalent. Peaking around grade 6-8. He would scream and curse at me and my mom, threaten me, throw and break stuff, and had a tendency to slap and hit me. My mom never did and still doesn’t see anything wrong, and she was also verbally evil. Both of them forced me to call him “dad”, which part of me understands cus my bio dad is absent, but I still hated it for a long time. 

I started experimenting with nicotine and alcohol at age 14, 9th grade after moving to a new area during the start of COVID. Nicotine first I believe, and at first I didn’t care for it. Until I actually inhaled. Got a crazy head rush and I was INSTANTLY hooked, so I’ve been smoking nicotine since then. Had a best friend (my only real friend tbh) at this time who would come over and stay the night often. One night he mentioned going down to my step-dad’s basement and swiping a couple beers. We snagged some tall boys and I couldn’t stand the taste, lol. Ended up drinking maybe half the beer, and feeling pretty nice. He kept coming over and I started drinking more, and started finishing bottles. I loved it. I started drinking when he wasn’t there, alone in my room at night, at school, and my step dad caught on to this and started putting alarms on his alcohol. 

I was miserable. I needed the feeling alcohol gave me. One evening I felt this feeling, and made a decision that opened the gates of hell in my life. I googled sum like “ways to get fucked up over the counter” or sum like that. I read somewhere that you can hallucinate off Benadryl. I walked to the store that evening, and stole a box of Benadryl. I started researching how much to take to “get high”, and used an online calculator to measure my dose. I took 11 pills. 275mgs. It kicked in, and I started to hallucinate. It had so many horrible side effects but just the fact that I was hallucinating and not sober made me fall in love. I did it the next day, increased my dose slightly. I took some time off then I my use skyrocketed. I used pretty much every other day, occasionally taking a couple days off.

I used it from ages 14-18. Using doses at high as 700mg. (1 Benadryl is 25mg) Benadryl fucked my body and brain up. My depression increased SIGNIFICANTLY, I would vomit every time I ate, had panic attacks & crippling anxiety, and my negative thinking became my only thinking. Around my 15th birthday I believe, I started using OTC cough syrup (DXM) after trying it in school one day. I felt incredible. This became my life. I would do it once every few days only because the high would sometimes last up to 3 days. From ages 15-19 I was using DXM constantly, and it became my ONLY thought in my head 24-7. I would do it before work, at school, at home, everywhere and anywhere. I started getting erratic, psychotic behavior from it.

After one episode I ran miles away from my grandmothers house leaving her front door open and calling 911 on myself. Stuff like this started happening ALOT, but I never told anybody how bad my use was so they assumed it was mostly mental illness. I got put on lots of medicine. I got kicked out for this and sent to my dads. I used still all the time, but never got caught, Until I became paranoid and brought a knife to school in 11th grade. I got arrested for 3 days and placed on house arrest. I attempted to kill myself that night by swallowing lots of ibuprofen and silica gel. I survived and told my dad, got send to another mental hospital, and another one and other one, and this became the cycle. I was in and out of at least 25 mental wards and residential facilities. Staying in some of these places for as long as 9 months. I started using Adderall and benzos and started drinking again and smoking weed. I got arrested a few times, once for felony robbery (did half a year in juvy) and 2 times for assault.

I had met a much older woman at age 16 who was 27 at the time and she was just super friendly at first, Writing page long letters while i was in facilities or locked up, calling and texting me paragraphs daily, etc. After getting released from Juvy on my 18th birthday, she told me she was in love with me. I had never really been in an actual relationship before. I got attached and so did she. She took my virginity on my 18th birthday when she was 29. We got engaged. We were in a relationship for just under a year. She broke up with me January this year for relapsing constantly. 

I now realize I was likely taken advantage of and groomed. I am still unable to process this correctly and am so hurt by it. I was a young naive teenager who didn’t know any better. After the breakup my use skyrocketed. I moved into a sober living house and started EVERYTHING, and eventually started using meth. I recently picked up opioids too. As of most recently (late march 2025), I have had multiple occasions where I have been very close to homelessness and have absolutely no money. I lost my job after the breakup, and am using meth and opiates daily now. 

At any point I could get drug tested and kicked out, but this doesn’t deter me. I’m too obsessed with getting high. I’m currently working on getting a new job and a sponsor, but I’ve been through that before. Feels like nothing can stop me. I’m at a loss. 
If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I really appreciate it.

Gonna tell a bit of a story and then ask for some guidance: I deeply care for our closest neighbors who are living in abject squalor, some are in active addiction, and all are living hand to mouth, one government check at a time. 3 grown adults, 1 fresh 18yo. Far too many animals with not enough means or give a fuck to do better. I know wanting to help is only productive if they want to help themselves; they genuinely think there is nothing wrong with their lifestyle although I know they’re uncomfortable most days and going without any semblance of general hygiene, home care, or animals care (no running water, no washer/dryer, sheets, tooth brushing, regular bathing, flea or tick treatment for the animals, a mountain of trash in the yard full of human excrement just to name a few things). We are hoping to give them access to tools to clean up their living space, and I try to lend a hand with the animals, get them spayed/neutered and their shots, help with food at the end of the month. I don’t mind bridging the gap when I can if they’re in a bind, but recently they took advantage of me, and I genuinely feel so hurt. Just don’t steal and lie to my face about it. It wasn’t much, but it’s the principle, it’s the disrespect. I knew not to trust them with too much, but I thought I could trust them with this. Part of me wants to not saying anything and just let my role in their lives dwindle and they’ll forget we exist other than friendly neighborly waves from a distance, and part of me wants to sit the person down who stole and lied to me and attempt to impart onto them how shitty that was in light of everything. How shitty that is to do to anyone, period. What would you do? Let sleeping dogs lie, or try to mend what they broke? My husband thinks it’s best to wait and see if they do what they have said they’ll do to right their wrong, which I think is sage.

I'd cycled through multiple treatment centers, never making it past 30 days sober. Honestly, I'd given up believing recovery was even possible for me. Then I found Windmill Wellness Ranch, and something shifted. They taught me recovery wasn't just about stopping substances it was about healing my mind, rebuilding relationships, and learning to love and respect myself again.

Recovery transformed me in ways I never imagined possible. Today, my relationships with my family and friends aren't just repaired, they're genuinely thriving. I'm part of a community where I support others in their journey, too, through Drew's Sober Living. I spend my days helping others find hope, build new lives, and believe in themselves again. I work, I mentor, I have routines and habits that keep me grounded and healthy.

What I want to share most of all is that no matter how dark or impossible things feel right now, recovery can genuinely transform your life. It’s not just about quitting drugs or alcohol, but about discovering who you really are beneath the struggle, reconnecting with people you love, and building a life you're proud of.

1jl2g82,Addiction,1743077540.0,"Hedonism Addiction can come in many forms. Drugs are, of course, the most addictive substances. They tickle the pleasure centers in the brain to release large quantities of dopamine. And, as if that wasn't enough, the adventure of finding drugs--going out into the world on a clandestine mission and indulging in the illicit--can be just as addictive as the physiological response itself. What I'm trying to say is that there is an undeniable allure to the acquisition of drugs that is hard to explain to those who have never partaken.  
  
Although it is hard to explain the many faces of addiction, I would venture to guess that everyone has been addicted to something at some point in their life. If not drugs, sex; if not sex, videogames; and if not videogames, true crime podcasts or Instagram or the social hour after church service that starts as a once a week obligation but turns into a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday affair. Of course not all addictions are as harmful as drugs, but since everyone has some type of addiction, we can use this knowledge to help explain, even in an imprecise or incomplete manner, what drug addicts feel and why they stay addicted against their own best judgment.  
  
To this end, I've written [an essay for LIT Magazine](https://www.litmagazine.org/the-hedonists-checklists/) about addiction--food addiction--focusing on how an addiction can take control of one's life. And particularly focusing on how addicts feed on their addiction, becoming experts in their specific domain. From my experience, addicts are often very intelligent people. Drug addicts, for instance, know the ins and outs of the chemical composition of the drugs the use and they learned everything they can about drug paraphernalia, drug laws, and even the history of their favorite drug.  
  
I think what underlies this tendency is an obsessive personality that further feeds their addiction. Fortunately, drugs are just one outlet that can be used to express such obsession. If channeled into less harmful activities, the same obsession can be harnessed for benefit. To this end the ritual that surrounds harmful addictive activity needs to be broken and replaced in order to fill the void that inevitably develops when addicts seek a way out of their cycle of dependence.  
  
Food, which happens to be the topic of my essay on addiction, exemplifies how one's energy can be channeled into other obsessions. If you read the essay and make it to the end, I'd love to know if you believe I've captured the sense of loss that occurs when overindulgence in pleasurable activity becomes heartrendingly mundane.",hedonism addiction come many forms drugs course addictive substances tickle pleasure centers brain release large quantities dopamine wasnt enough adventure finding drugsgoing world clandestine mission indulging illicitcan addictive physiological response im trying say undeniable allure acquisition drugs hard explain never partaken although hard explain many faces addiction would venture guess everyone addicted something point life drugs sex sex videogames videogames true crime podcasts instagram social hour church service starts week obligation turns monday wednesday friday sunday affair course addictions harmful drugs since everyone type addiction use knowledge help explain even imprecise incomplete manner drug addicts feel stay addicted best judgment end ive written essay lit magazine addictionfood addictionfocusing addiction take control ones life particularly focusing addicts feed addiction becoming experts specific domain experience addicts often intelligent people drug addicts instance know ins outs chemical composition drugs use learned everything drug paraphernalia drug laws even history favorite drug think underlies tendency obsessive personality feeds addiction fortunately drugs one outlet used express obsession channeled less harmful activities obsession harnessed benefit end ritual surrounds harmful addictive activity needs broken replaced order fill void inevitably develops addicts seek way cycle dependence food happens topic essay addiction exemplifies ones energy channeled obsessions read essay make end id love know believe ive captured sense loss occurs overindulgence pleasurable activity becomes heartrendingly mundane,0,1,Positive,Moderate Concern

I always see how addictions are commonly from childhood trauma but mine is literally the opposite. I had the most amazing childhood that adulthood literally came as a shock and it's no where near as great as I always thought it would be.

Below are my addictions and I just don't know how to overcome them and can't afford a therapist. I've seen a doctor in the past but they just offer medication which I don't want to take.

1. Gaming/gambling - i play several hours a day and the games have microtransactions that give me a buzz when I open packs but then instantly feel regret when I realise the money I've wasted. I've stopped playing for the last 3 days and packed away the PlayStation 

2. Alcohol - i drink heavily atleast 3 or 4 times a week where I often blackout. I'm so far a week from not drinking but having a beer is all I can think about

4. Soda - I'm having a family size bottle pretty much every 2 days and just can't stop the habit. I've cut down to 1 can a day but I still crave it all day.

5. Porn - TMI but I don't mastabate but rather just randomly watch it for no reason when I'm bored and I don't know why

6. Vaping - i go through 1 disposable a day and I absolutely hate it but feel to addicted to stop. It makes me so tired and kills any motivation I have

I don't understand why I'm so addicted to so many things. I know I'm not happy with where I'm at career wise which may be causing the problem but the addictions are almost holding me hostage and stopping me from being my best.",many addictions im feeling exhausted random addictions would really grateful advice anyone share always see addictions commonly childhood trauma mine literally opposite amazing childhood adulthood literally came shock near great always thought would addictions dont know overcome cant afford therapist ive seen doctor past offer medication dont want take gaminggambling play several hours day games microtransactions give buzz open packs instantly feel regret realise money ive wasted ive stopped playing last days packed away playstation alcohol drink heavily atleast times week often blackout im far week drinking beer think soda im family size bottle pretty much every days cant stop habit ive cut day still crave day porn tmi dont mastabate rather randomly watch reason im bored dont know vaping go disposable day absolutely hate feel addicted stop makes tired kills motivation dont understand im addicted many things know im happy im career wise may causing problem addictions almost holding hostage stopping best,4,1,Neutral,High Risk

1jkpn9w,Addiction,1743030788.0,"Best friends boyfriend drinks after stopping pills So its a long long story, but last year my best friend discovered her boyfriend was abusing Xanax, oxycodone, and Adderall. He's been on suboxone for about 6 years now and has only relapsed during times he didn't have access to it. 

However, now that he's not on the pills as far as we know (I don't believe he is, but I don't live with him), he drinks. Now, my friend says it's one or 2 bottles/cans every now and then and never to get drunk and she doesn't see a problem with it. 

Personally, I'm concerned about the potential to fall into alcoholism. I also found out recently that they've taken molly together a few times in the last 8ish months or so. 

Now, I don't really like her boyfriend, so I'm trying to get some outside perspectives. Is this something to be concerned about or am I just trying to find problems where there aren't any? 

Edit: 

I want to make it clear that I don't plan to or want to bring any of this up to her. I've said my piece to her before, and the one time was enough. I recognize she's an adult that can make choices for herself, and I'm not trying to influence those choices in any way. I just know how much pain she was in going through everything with him before, and I want to get some outside perspectives to have a clearer idea of what to expect. 

My personal feelings about him aside, I'm just concerned about my friend and want to know what the recovery journey looks like - both for my own education and to not worry about it so much. While I don't believe any part of this post warranted any amount of hostility in the comments, I recognize there's a lot of stigma surrounding addiction and people who don't struggle with it may come off as judgmental, so for that I apologize. 

For those of you who've given me real insight into some aspects of recovery, thank you. I'm taking it all to heart so that I can make sure to keep my personal feelings about him separate from his journey. I don't believe substance abuse is a moral failing in any way and recognize it's a failure on society's part to take care of its people.

1jk7agv,Addiction,1742979117.0,"Very major effects from cocaine now - normal? Hi everyone. I wanted to talk about some side effects I’ve started experiencing on cocaine because they are pretty major in my opinion. 

So firstly I take mounjaro, I’m around the 13 stone mark now, and don’t eat much which may have an effect however my skinny friends who eat the same don’t get this. 

On top of this, it’s worth noting that yesterday I’d taken 4 tramadol throughout the morning and afternoon and 3 gabapentin due to back pain. I took cocaine around 3 hours after my last dose. 

So I was a weekly user, Friday would come and without fail the pain would eat me alive. Didn’t matter where I was (usually at work), I’d get 1.5 around lunch time and do a 15 hour bender. The last 3 or 4 times of this, it made my heart beat out of my chest that fast, my neck was be in severe severe agony from stiffness, my arms would go number, chest pain, genuinely heart attack symptoms. Pulsating in my head and tingling sensations. Anyway this was enough to put me off. 

I gave it 2 weeks and tried again, same again not as strong. 

I now give it 3 weeks up until last night. I didn’t have the tingling, chest pain and numbness. However what I did have, my throat felt like it was closing, my entire neck and arteries were pulsating Including the ball of my throat up to my chin, this lasted for 4 hours, struggling to breath and swallow. As well as the agonising neck pain. 

I’d like to understand if my body in a total rejection or are these things common symptoms? I never used to have anything like this! It’s been a new thing. 

Besides all that, I know my cocaine journey is over. I wish I could afford rehab but I can’t, but I’m excited to start this journey which will be hard but hopefully pays off! 

Thanks a lot  

Edit: also think knowing that it’s not normal will help me stop because I know it’s not normal, I just need everyone else to tell me this too.

1jk4xfx,Addiction,1742968257.0,"My Life Is In Ruins Let me just start off by saying that my now ex girlfriend/baby mama (31F), and I (34M) are cocaine addicts. It has completely destroyed our lives.

I've been using for about 4 years, and she has been using for about 12 years. The last 2 have been the worst of my life.

I started to lose control when my grandma's (the woman that raised me) health started to decline severely. When she died 2 years ago, I went into a grief spiral, and completely nuked everything.

The following is what I've been through in just the last year alone:

-5 pinks slips
-3 job firings
-2 break ups w/ my baby mama (yesterday was the second time)
-1 accidental cocaine overdose
-1 fetty lace overdose
-1 apartment eviction
-2 inpatient rehabs
-1 sober living (Got kicked out for relapsing)

I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I hate it. So much. It has taken nearly everything from me. In the last 24 hours, it has cost me my job, and my relationship.

She was everything to me. I fought so fucking hard for her. Harder than I've ever fought for anyone, including myself. She was my person. My soulmate.

The drugs changed us both. It stole our attention away from everything that mattered. We were best friends, partners, and lovers.

I have gotten better with my usage, but her's has gotten so much worse. It's taking her mental health to extremely dangerous places. We are both toxic individuals, and it's worse in our relationship. We both just keep triggering and enabling each other.

I hope that one day we will get sober and healthy, and we'll have a chance to try again. Staying together now will only hurt or kill each other.

I'm trying to focus on myself and my sons, but it's still fresh. If not being with me saves her life, then I will gladly sacrifice what I want. This is hard. She was the love of my life. The only woman that ever made me feel seen, heard, and understood. She made me feel unconditionally loved.

I know I have to let her go to save us both, but I love her so fucking much. Things have to get better from here. This is my last chance to save myself.

1jk1ht7,Addiction,1742956112.0,"From meth to mindfulness—here’s how I rebuilt after addiction almost took everything I’ve been through it. Meth, alcohol, chaos, burnout—addiction had its claws in every part of my life. I lost friends, nearly lost family, and honestly lost myself.

But I fought back. I’m still fighting.
What saved me wasn’t luck—it was structure. Routine. Mental rewiring.
I realized if I wanted to change, I had to reprogram how I thought and how I lived.

Here’s what helped most:

•Routine > motivation – Mornings and nights became non-negotiable

•Fitness – Boxing, resistance training, and movement changed my energy

•Mindfulness & journaling – Rewiring my self-talk and patterns

•Spiritual growth – Dispenza, NA, Māori wisdom—all tools to reconnect

•Service – Giving back gave me direction again

I’m not here to pretend I’ve got it all figured out.

1jjzyk3,Addiction,1742951570.0,"I want to quit practicing addiction medicine! I've been practicing addiction medicine in some form for almost 26 years. Never in my career have I felt more defeated or wanted to quit as much as I do right now.

I have a patient I've known since she was 17. Over the years, she became more than just a patient to me; she felt like one of my daughters. Even after she moved out of state, we kept in touch regularly. Her mother and I tried everything we could think of to help her become sober and to keep her alive.

In my career, I've only worked with patients who've already chosen to become sober. That's who walks into my office. She originally came to me with her mother for help at 17. Every doctor said she was addicted to opioids, but no one wanted to help because of her age. For them, it was incredibly challenging, frustrating, and heartbreaking. But I gladly took her in. At the time, I had a concierge addiction practice which meant I had all the time in the world to spend with each patient. I helped her become sober from opioids. I remembered that the text messages between her, her mother, and I numbered in the thousands. She stopped the opioids but the cocaine and benzodiazepines continued. I sent her to counseling, psychiatry for her mental health, but she just wouldn't stop. I wouldn't fire her because I feared she would ultimately relapse and die from an opioid overdose.

She eventually moved out of state but we kept in touch. Recently, she went into an inpatient facility and became sober from everything. However, she was not taking methadone or buprenorphine. So, I feared she would eventually have a lapse and return to opioids or another drug. PAWS is a real thing and most clinics don't warn patients. She maintained 8 weeks of sobriety and her mind was starting to clear up. She started to realized how F up her life was. She started speaking like a mature adult and had goals. Everything started getting better. Wow was the thought on my mind every time we talked. But I was so afraid of that lapse.

Saturday, her mother sent me a text. She died from an overdose. The police believe it was from opioids based upon what they found. It’s seriously haunting me.

All of my appointments are audio recorded. I've been listening to them as I drive. Our conversations were like those I have with my own daughters. I find myself wishing that I'd spoken with her more, reached out more often, or said something different. But to be honest with myself, I can't imagine what I could have said to make things any different!! I am so angry right now. But I don't know what else I could have done. I don't know what I am going to say or do when I see the parents. They have to go without their 25 year old daughter. I still have mine. Life is so unfair and I can't continue to see young people die like this. As much as I want to quit, I know I have so many people depending on me right now to help them with their journey. I need to get my motivation back.",want quit practicing addiction medicine ive practicing addiction medicine form almost years never career felt defeated wanted quit much right patient ive known since years became patient felt like one daughters even moved state kept touch regularly mother tried everything could think help become sober keep alive career ive worked patients whove already chosen become sober thats walks office originally came mother help every doctor said addicted opioids one wanted help age incredibly challenging frustrating heartbreaking gladly took time concierge addiction practice meant time world spend patient helped become sober opioids remembered text messages mother numbered thousands stopped opioids cocaine benzodiazepines continued sent counseling psychiatry mental health wouldnt stop wouldnt fire feared would ultimately relapse die opioid overdose eventually moved state kept touch recently went inpatient facility became sober everything however taking methadone buprenorphine feared would eventually lapse return opioids another drug paws real thing clinics dont warn patients maintained weeks sobriety mind starting clear started realized f life started speaking like mature adult goals everything started getting better wow thought mind every time talked afraid lapse saturday mother sent text died overdose police believe opioids based upon found seriously haunting appointments audio recorded ive listening drive conversations like daughters find wishing id spoken reached often said something different honest cant imagine could said make things different angry right dont know else could done dont know going say see parents go without year old daughter still mine life unfair cant continue see young people die like much want quit know many people depending right help journey need get motivation back,11,27,Positive,Low Concern
1jjza53,Addiction,1742949610.0,"Will someone like this ever come back? I need real stories + insight, please! I’m really struggling with the aftermath of a connection I had that felt intense, chaotic, and emotionally confusing—and I need help understanding if people like this ever come back… or if I’ve truly been left in permanent limbo.

I connected with a man who I now realize fits the fearful avoidant attachment style almost perfectly on snap. In addition to that, he’s extremely insecure, avoids vulnerability at all costs, and is a long-time meth user—so I’m dealing with not just avoidance, but emotional instability, self-sabotage, and addiction-related behavior.

Here’s what happened and what I observed:
	•	He opened up to me at times, showing a soft, almost reverent side—but always quickly veered back into flirtation or sex talk when things got too real.
	•	He seemed genuinely surprised that I was attracted to him and emotionally responsive—almost like he didn’t believe he deserved it.
	•	Anytime things started feeling close, he would vanish. But then he would watch me from what I believe were burner accounts. I was also reached out by him I believe by multiple burner accounts in 1 day after I noticed a strange looking account viewing my stories. They sent me kind of eerie cryptic messages. One of them after every response I would give would just send a question mark after each response of mine. This continued all day until I eventually stopped accepting all requests I was getting and then they stopped. 
	•	He never blocked me on his main Snapchat account, where we originally spoke. But he also never opened my last message.
	•	I stopped responding to the burners last week, and since then… silence. He’s still showing small signs of life on the original page—his Snap score bumps up occasionally—but no direct contact after all the burner stuff went down I sent a message just saying hey sorry I haven’t sent anything for a bit, just always afraid I’m bothering someone, hope all is good. Which is sitting in his snap messages unopened.
	•	He’s the kind of person who seems emotionally reliant in relationships, especially to help him stay clean. I’ve heard he’s used connections in the past like a crutch for stability.

Right now, I feel stuck in emotional limbo. He hasn’t said goodbye. He hasn’t reached out. But he also hasn’t disappeared completely. Just hovering in silence. I’m devastated.

And I’m scared that because I stopped replying to the burners, he’s going to stay away out of shame or fear. But I also know meth users and avoidants tend to loop back when the crash hits hard enough.

My questions are:
	1.	Have you dealt with someone like this before—someone emotionally avoidant, insecure, and struggling with addiction?
	2.	Did they ever come back—even just to test the waters again?
	3.	If they did come back… how long did it take, and what triggered it?
	4.	Is this silence likely just another part of the avoidant cycle—or is it actually final?

I know I sound like I’m holding onto hope… and I probably am. But I also want truth. If this is how it ends, I need to know. But if this is part of a bigger cycle, I want to prepare myself emotionally for how that usually plays out.

Please be real with me. I don’t need sugar. I need stories, experience, clarity.

Thank you so much in advance",someone like ever come back need real stories insight please im really struggling aftermath connection felt intense chaotic emotionally confusingand need help understanding people like ever come back ive truly left permanent limbo connected man realize fits fearful avoidant attachment style almost perfectly snap addition hes extremely insecure avoids vulnerability costs longtime meth userso im dealing avoidance emotional instability selfsabotage addictionrelated behavior heres happened observed opened times showing soft almost reverent sidebut always quickly veered back flirtation sex talk things got real seemed genuinely surprised attracted emotionally responsivealmost like didnt believe deserved anytime things started feeling close would vanish would watch believe burner accounts also reached believe multiple burner accounts day noticed strange looking account viewing stories sent kind eerie cryptic messages one every response would give would send question mark response mine continued day eventually stopped accepting requests getting stopped never blocked main snapchat account originally spoke also never opened last message stopped responding burners last week since silence hes still showing small signs life original pagehis snap score bumps occasionallybut direct contact burner stuff went sent message saying hey sorry havent sent anything bit always afraid im bothering someone hope good sitting snap messages unopened hes kind person seems emotionally reliant relationships especially help stay clean ive heard hes used connections past like crutch stability right feel stuck emotional limbo hasnt said goodbye hasnt reached also hasnt disappeared completely hovering silence im devastated im scared stopped replying burners hes going stay away shame fear also know meth users avoidants tend loop back crash hits hard enough questions dealt someone like beforesomeone emotionally avoidant insecure struggling addiction ever come backeven test waters come back long take triggered silence likely another part avoidant cycleor actually final know sound like im holding onto hope probably also want truth ends need know part bigger cycle want prepare emotionally usually plays please real dont need sugar need stories experience clarity thank much advance,1,2,Neutral,Low Concern

1jjxstf,Addiction,1742945511.0,"I no longer have a crutch I am now almost a year clean in porn addiction as well as alcoholism. Something hit me like a bitch today and I wish to annotate it here. This stuff is basic AF so all of y'all who are professionals at recovery and go read something else.

I no longer have a crutch. When it hurts inside, I no longer have any of my go to activities - porn and/or alcohol - to turn to in order to numb the inner pain. That one thing that hit me like a bitch today is that I no longer have the same tolerance for being treated like shit in the outside world. Before when I was treated like shit - by my friends or lovers, by my employer or random strangers - I always would turn to my crutch, my two addictions to manage that. To quite the storm and hurt. This acting out of my addictive behavior was ironically a tolerance for being treated like this. It was a tolerance for abuse and neglect. Of years of abuse and neglect. And because I would almost always turn to this crutch, I actually never developed the skills to communicate, guard against or otherwise take measures against blatant or subtle mistreatment. Instead of bringing it up with friends, lovers and employers, I would turn against myself. I would act out my addictions.

Now I need to transfer the pressure away from my body and place it back in the world. I need to manage the outside world such that it gradually becomes a better and healthier place for me to be in. I no longer have the same tolerance for shit now that I am sober. I no longer have a crutch. I no longer have a facility that can take shit from people and tolerate it. I am no longer willing to turn against myself.

But this is a skill and like all skills it takes time. It is so multifaceted. For example on the more simpler side, I need to express my feelings well and clearly when I am insulted. That requires communication and on the spot emotional regulations skills. On the more complex side, I was willing in my days of addiction to work nights and weekends. Now that I am sober, NO WAY! I need my sleep and I need it regularized. I need my weekends to be with kith and kin and with nature and hobbies. That requires new work and new work skills.

It is as if a sober life and a life of addiction are worlds apart. That does not surprise me. What did  surprise me was while I thought the inner worlds are apart, it is also so that the outer worlds are  apart. What was also shocking for me was how much of the world rests on heads and pain of addicts. All those shit, low paying and insecure jobs propel people to addiction. Employers that broke the backs of miners and farm workers for example needed some or most of those workers to turn to addiction to manage the shit of the work. Porn stars and air traffic controllers come to mind as well. It is sad to think that some of the wealth I see in society is paid for or extracted from addicted bodies.

Wish me luck and love everybody! God speed and I wish you sobriety today! 🫶",longer crutch almost year clean porn addiction well alcoholism something hit like bitch today wish annotate stuff basic af yall professionals recovery go read something else longer crutch hurts inside longer go activities porn andor alcohol turn order numb inner pain one thing hit like bitch today longer tolerance treated like shit outside world treated like shit friends lovers employer random strangers always would turn crutch two addictions manage quite storm hurt acting addictive behavior ironically tolerance treated like tolerance abuse neglect years abuse neglect would almost always turn crutch actually never developed skills communicate guard otherwise take measures blatant subtle mistreatment instead bringing friends lovers employers would turn would act addictions need transfer pressure away body place back world need manage outside world gradually becomes better healthier place longer tolerance shit sober longer crutch longer facility take shit people tolerate longer willing turn skill like skills takes time multifaceted example simpler side need express feelings well clearly insulted requires communication spot emotional regulations skills complex side willing days addiction work nights weekends sober way need sleep need regularized need weekends kith kin nature hobbies requires new work new work skills sober life life addiction worlds apart surprise surprise thought inner worlds apart also outer worlds apart also shocking much world rests heads pain addicts shit low paying insecure jobs propel people addiction employers broke backs miners farm workers example needed workers turn addiction manage shit work porn stars air traffic controllers come mind well sad think wealth see society paid extracted addicted bodies wish luck love everybody god speed wish sobriety today,3,5,Negative,Moderate Concern

It’s like I’m trying to claw my way out of this mess while everyone around me is just casually using and acting like it’s no big deal.  People talk about doing drugs and it’s fucking normal or even expected. 

I asked a friend to help me out by NOT giving me drugs if I asked because I’m really trying to quit meth (& coke).

1jjwefy,Addiction,1742941869.0,"losing my virginity to a hooker led to me spending majority of my life savings, cant even stop either long story short, im 21 years old, and have spent the last 6 years of my life completely alone for the most part, i have no social life, i was the lonely loser in highschool that would hide in the bathrooms to kill time. i didnt ever get female attention, really i would avoid them for the most part out of insecurity. i still live with my family, but being the oldest out of my siblings i really felt eager to get financially free asap, i started putting most my life savings in the stockmarket as soon as i turned 18 and i stayed disciplined up until i was 20, i would do a lot of unnecessary stuff to save money, and it payed off i suppose, at my peak last year i had 50k saved up in stock equity (most i ever had)

to add more context i was always addicted to porn, i had discovered it and frequently watched it in my middleschool years of my life and it went on until i was 20, then it started to get more severe, onlyfans starts spreading, its all that pops up on my feed now, so i give in, in total i probably spent like 4k-6k on OF i would rather not check but thats my closest guess. 

eventually my 50k networth at 20 gets closer to like 35k at the end of last year, because i also did help my family with their credit card debt and my part of the bills for the year

its now a week before valentines day in 2025 and im super sad one day for whatever reason i get the bright idea of finally losing my virginity to a hooker, i was already in the area, the first time i got scammed, the second time i finally lost my virginity! i felt a boost in ego, and wanted more immediately, in total my first week after finding where to go, i had already spent 2grand , i would tell myself stuff like, i wont let my account go lower than 30k, then it gets that low, now im saying 25k is my limit, it got so bad my 35k at the start of this year is now  only 12k as of today :(

i think the first 3 weeks of doing this it was the excitement of sex that kept me going but then i started to gain attachment with just one regular hooker, and i would say thats what really started to get me to spend irrational amounts certain nights, sometimes i wish i never met her, but sometimes i hate to see her go, so i pay extra to stay with her longer, my porn addiction essentially translated to a sex addiction i would always go crazy amounts of rounds for no reason, it didnt hit me that wasnt normal until one day she, a hooker, called me a sex addict that kinda made me think after that day.

 i still regularly go to her and like i said its not even about the sex at this point i enjoy her presence we usually hang out in between rounds just talking while we smoke or get something to eat, i still get anxious around her but just the ease of having someone engaged enough to make me feel noticed feels good, really good, i cant let it go, and i dont even want to try and replicate it with anyone else i know its unhealthy and im just stuck in a money pit by paying for sex and company but ive just lost all motivation in life i guess

1jr79h8,offmychest,1743756537.0,"Feeling indifferent towards the guy I’m seeing after checking my “ex’s” social media. Last year November, I was discarded in the most vile way by this guy I thought was my friend. Unfortunately, we were intimate which caused me to form an attachment towards him because I don’t know how have healthy attachments with people. I ended up being abused both physically, emotionally and verbally and it drained me. When I say drained, I mean I was self-harming myself (never done that before), idealising and almost attempting a (what would’ve been) suicide, isolated myself from everyone and completely disregarded my studies.  The entire, break up had me feeling so shitty that I was constantly calling him as I didn’t know how to cope or move on from him. He was all I had but in the end he ended up calling the police on me (currently under investigation).

Now I haven’t spoken or checked up on him since I was arrested. Seeing him hurt. Knowing that nobody cared about me and took his side left me feeling broken and useless. I felt like a joke, like a waste of space. I didn’t go lectures, I simply wanted to give up with live because I didn’t want to live anymore. The whole situation was humiliating.

After missing a good chunk of the semester, I finally started coming back to uni and met this guy. He made me feel like life was worth living. He truly one of the best people I’ve met so far. He’s truly a great person. He has drive, ambition, he’s confident, attentive, the type to put others before himself and he’s honestly just one of those people where being around him makes you feel like you can do anything. He’s so great and he’s just amazing. But early this morning, I went and checked the “exes” page and seeing his post triggered me back into a depression.

I don’t know why. I don’t like him in any capacity. I honestly don’t. I don’t even want to be around him. He makes me miserable and yet here I was bawling my eyes out at fucking 3am in the morning. I quickly shot a text to the new guy that I’m seeing and he called me straight away and stayed on the phone with me for almost 3 hours til I felt better. He said the most kindest shit ever and I just wanted to be with him in that moment. He’s so great. But now, I’m deeping it and I just don’t feel the same way I felt anymore.

It’s like I was in this protective bubble. Like nothing mattered, I mean I still had the thought of my “ex” in my head but he didn’t trigger me like this. Probs because I wasn’t seeing him or anything to do with him. But now that I did, I can’t help but feel like I’ve lost interest in the new guy. He’s amazing but I don’t feel ready. I don’t feel like I want him. Like I honestly feel turned off from him and I fucking hate that. I hate my brain. I feel disgusted by him. I’m thinking about all the little things he does that pisses me off and how even thinking about certain behaviours pisses me off. Like I just feel annoyed by him.

The nights used to be mine—my quiet time of solitude to de-stress and recharge after long and boring days. Now, they just... arrive, like an unwelcome guest heavy with a sadness both immense and intangible. Seeking guidance, I went to my therapist, but as I waited in her office, the words wouldn't form. My mind felt like a blank slate, unable to translate the inner turmoil into something coherent. I ultimately left her office before the session even began.

I've tried talking to others, but each time, I feel myself step outside of myself. It's like watching a recording of me saying ""I'm fine"" while the real me retreats into a silent corner. There's no genuine connection in my current conversations anyway.

As more nights have passed, this feeling of disconnection from reality intensifies. On some nights, it's as if a switch flips, and the last few hours simply vanish. It's not just forgetting; it's a complete absence, a void in my memory. I'm suddenly present again, feeling numb and deeply disoriented, wondering what my body has been doing without my conscious awareness.

When emotions overwhelmed me, I would often retreat to the vacant apartment gym at night. There, I would unleash my frustration on the punching bag, each strike a physical manifestation of the thoughts clouding my mind. The raw power in every punch was exhilarating, the closest I have ever felt to being powerful. However, now that driving force has dissipated. Each punch feels weak now, even painful. It is only recently that I have noticed the faint bruises blooming on my fingers, yet I recall no memory of when I might have been hurt.

Even when sleep finally comes, it's not a real rest. I wake up with this jolt of panic, heart racing for absolutely no reason. It feels like I should be terrified, as if I just escaped some terrible nightmare, but the details are always just out of reach, a frustrating blank—just this lingering sense of dread.",nights arent mine anymore something wrote journal tonight felt like sharing entry rather tucking away nights used minemy quiet time solitude destress recharge long boring days arrive like unwelcome guest heavy sadness immense intangible seeking guidance went therapist waited office words wouldnt form mind felt like blank slate unable translate inner turmoil something coherent ultimately left office session even began ive tried talking others time feel step outside like watching recording saying im fine real retreats silent corner theres genuine connection current conversations anyway nights passed feeling disconnection reality intensifies nights switch flips last hours simply vanish forgetting complete absence void memory im suddenly present feeling numb deeply disoriented wondering body without conscious awareness emotions overwhelmed would often retreat vacant apartment gym night would unleash frustration punching bag strike physical manifestation thoughts clouding mind raw power every punch exhilarating closest ever felt powerful however driving force dissipated punch feels weak even painful recently noticed faint bruises blooming fingers yet recall memory might hurt even sleep finally comes real rest wake jolt panic heart racing absolutely reason feels like terrified escaped terrible nightmare details always reach frustrating blankjust lingering sense dread,0,2,Negative,High Risk

The thing is I always, always get stressed out by every little inconvenience, since I was a child when I had to make a presentation, talk to people or anything with just a bit of responsibility in it I put so much pressure on myself that I always fell sick, like physically sick, and couldn't get better until right after the event was over.
I always hated this about me, but it was somewhat manageable because it only used to happen with events or exams, etc. But recently it's also been happening with my relationships, I've realized that I'm so so afraid of anybody betraying me or seeing me as a annoyance, not being reciprocated or of someone just not seeing me as someone important to them the same way they are important to me that I'm super insecure about anything, I now realize thats probably the reason my las relation ship ended, at the beginning she was supportive about my insecurities and all, but it should be such a weigh for her than couldn't do it anymore and began treating me bad, like getting angry at any word I said and yelling at me for some minor things like not handing her a sheet of paper correctly, I think she wanted me to end the relationship but after seeing I wouldn't do it at the end she did it herself, and now I kind of understand her, like I would go paranoid about any little thing, like seeing her talking with someone else, she forgetting to tell me when she was at home, not answering me for some days, etc. Like, my first thought would always be that she was cheating on me, that I was not important to her, or that she was just using me for some weird reason.
Now I afraid the same thing will happen in my current relationship, seeing her going out with friends makes me feel like she doesn't enjoy spending time with me, when she priorises her best friend over me, when she doesn't initiates conversations  the first thing I think is how much she hates me and how I'm nothing to nobody, but until now everything has had a logical explanation, she has make me feel better and is nice to me, but recently I think I might have pass a line and that now she may actually be fed up with me, I don't blame her, frankly I hate myself too, I'm garbage and I'm honestly impressed she put up with me to begin with, and, I'm just so so sick of always overthinking everything, ruining all my relationships because of my insecurities, how can I get better?

I'd like to meet someone who is kind, patient, understanding, someone that will love me for who I am. I've asked girls out before and it didn't work out, none of those reasons were because of me from what I remember. It's just that the world can feel like a very lonely place without someone by my side.

How can I find people that I can interact with and have a romantic/sexual relationship with? I do want to find my first girlfriend, but it has been tough for me. It hasn't been easy and I'd like to ask for help if anyone understands. I'm worried about people that will judge me for my condition, so I stay away from others to avoid feeling that pain of rejection again. I try to be as outgoing as I can be with my college professors, but I'm very reluctant to be fully myself around others because of my interests.

I love video games, music, and writing. I care about my family and my best friend is the closest thing to the brother I wish I had as a kid. Recently, I've been feeling depressed and anxious because I'm afraid of becoming lost in all of the change that comes with taking steps forward. I'm a very conscious person who always thinks about how their actions affect others. I don't use drugs or drink either. I'm fully clean on that front because I just naturally dislike those things. I'm very passionate about Gran Turismo because I grew up playing this game. But if I had a girlfriend that was comfortable with talking about video games, I feel like I would be a happier person.

I fear rejection and I'm scared of being alone in the outside world. Right now I feel so lonely that I'm crying because I believe nobody is out there for me. Things feel hopeless right now and I am so stressed out with feeling depressed and like I'm never going to find someone.

I’ve been working since I was 13—just part-time at first while I was in school and university, but I’ve never really had a break. Now I’m a teacher, and I recently saw a job opportunity that caught my eye. But at the same time, I keep wondering… do I even *want* another job right now?  

So much has happened over the years, and I’ve just kept going. I’ve never really stopped to process things properly. Recently, I had to go back to my home country because my dad passed away. It was an awful time, and I felt deep sadness —but strangely, one thing *did* change. When I didn’t have to think about work at all, that constant weight I always carry just… lifted. I still felt grief, but the stress that I thought was just part of me was suddenly *gone*.  

That realization hit me hard. It sucks because I *have* to work—I need to pay for things and survive—but maybe taking a break could help me actually find myself again. I’ve always thought that *not* working was a bad thing, like being lazy. But now I wonder if pushing myself nonstop has just dulled everything else in my life. I don’t think I’ve been able to regulate myself properly for years.

1jr51ab,offmychest,1743746881.0,"I'm lonely and filled with so much sadness and rage I'm in my mid 20s (f) and for the past 6 years, I've been fighting depression. This past year, it seems to be getting worse and with my current job, it amplifies my loneliness. I work evenings to night time at a hospital, so even though I live with my mom and sibling, I don't see them until the weekends (or not at all because they have their significant others that they spend time with). My friends also have significant others so they don't talk to me as much as they used to. I wish this wasn't the case. 

My only solace were my two dogs. They brought me so much joy and companionship that my deep loneliness went away. One of them was a puppy and the other was an adult dog, getting close to senior but I had her for 7 years. The puppy got parvo in September (despite being vaccinated). It was a very stressful time with so much emotional rollercoasters, money gone, and lack of support from my family (emotionally). My mom forced me to put him down even though the vet told me the vaccine company would cover the cost if I waited a couple of hours until their offices open (it was 2 am). She kept yelling at me and kept saying things that tore my heart. In the end, she won. That same morning, she left to go on a trip with her boyfriend.

I guess I shouldn't have expected her to drop the trip because her daughter was mourning over her dog. I  just thought since I was there when she got cancer (skipped a semester of college to take care of her) that she would also be there for me. I guess it was wrong of me to assume that. But what hurt so much was that no one really came to check up on me. Why am I always expected to lend a hand but others can't do the same? Am I wrong? I don't know. But I swear, I felt like this incident altered my brain chemistry because there's so much rage, sadness, and loneliness inside of me that I feel like I'm being consumed by it slowly.

Fast forward to March and my mom lost my dog in the morning while I was asleep. I kept telling her when she let my dog out, to put her on a leash or at least watch the dog because my dog has this tendency of going to a neighbor's house to play with their dog. But like always, she ignored my warnings. She let my dog out and lost her. 2 hrs after she lost her, my mom woke me up. In my haste to find my dog, I fell down the stairs and ended up hurting my foot really bad. So I couldn't search for her as throughouly as I should have and I had to go to work. My mom disregarded my emotions once again when I was crying over her losing my dog and throughout the next two weeks I was so angry I couldn't speak at all but the basic stuff at work in fear of snapping on someone innocent. 

Last week, I hired a pet investigator to help me find my dog and she was able to find out that she was picked up and that there's a man that's been taking down my missing dog posters. I had a small argument with my mom about her paying the fees for my dog's return (reward or investigator fee) since it was her fault my dog got lost but she's very cheap and only cares about using her money to buy more houses (yeah she's a landlady unfortunately \*sighs\*) or for herself and her vacations. It's always money with her (and with my sibling too). I feel insane being in this family that only cares about money when I'm not like that. Anyway, the last update I got from my dog was that the man who took down my posters is somewhere in this neighborhood. More to come. I just hope the man didn't sell my dog off. She's my baby and I miss her so much. I would do anything to get her back. I will sell everything I have just to have her again. 

I just wished my mom listened to my warnings but it seems like the theme of my life is that my gut is always right but whenever I try to warn people, they never listen. No one ever listens to me. It's as if I'm mute to them. 

Why am I writing this? I don't know. I think I just want someone to listen to me since the people in my life don't. I wish someone would comfort me. I've always had to be strong and take care of other people in their time of need but when I need someone to help me, no one shows up and I have to do everything on my own. I'm angry at everything. I'm seething in rage but I have to pretend I'm ok.

In the past, I used to self harm when I was angry at myself. I've been clean for 5 years but these events has me itching to start again. Since I work at a hospital, I've been considering walking to the emergency room after work just because sometimes I don't feel safe and really need someone to intervene in case I do something dumb.

1jr4onm,offmychest,1743745498.0,"I want him to forget I existed TW: Abuse 



When I turned 18 I had my experience talking to a guy romantically. It developed quickly. As time went on, he’s behavior was more unpredictable. Before I could blink I was in a verbally abusive relationship. 

No one truly ever tells people just how much a relationship like that affects you. I truly felt like I lost my sanity. The happiness I felt being with him when things were great was so addictive. But then being threatened and yelled out made me feel so miserable, that all I wanted to do was go back to him so I could make the anxiety stop. 

Even admitting that makes me sick. But the truth is, it takes the right person to make you forget what kind of person you were before them. I’m glad I remembered myself. 

It’s been a few years since then and I’m healed from it. I was pretty depressed then and after the relationship, so it makes it hard for me to remember every detail. But I’m doing so much better and have such an amazing boyfriend. One who I hope to marry. The love I have for him is so pure and I truly believe in his love. I have zero doubts when he tells me how much I mean to him. I’ve been so grateful for that. 

Lately, I’ve been bothered by the fact that I’ve been in other fleeting relationships. I didn’t know I’d get to experience the love I have now.

I feel extremely depressed from time to time and I can't get out of bed, much less care about work. And then I slowly recover. But then I'm just trying to keep up with course work and playing catch up, and I have no time to learn anything or upskill. I don't know what I want or what I should be doing, and I just end up rotting. Catching up, rotting, catching up, rotting.


I've tried therapy but I can't be vulnerable, especially to a stranger. I feel like the people in my life have better things to do than deal with my shit so I can't open up to them either. I can't make friends. I piss off existing ones by being distant weeks at a time. I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I'm not.


I thought that once you got out of a depressive episode, you're stronger and can do better. But I feel like it's like I'm crawling out of a hole. Each time I drag myself out, eventually I fall back in. And each time I've fallen back in, it gets harder to drag myself out. I'm so incredibly tired and I don't know why I'm doing anything anymore. I feel so exhausted about trying. Part of me just wants to end it but I'm my parents only child and I can't do that to them, they've been perfectly nice. I'm the problem. 


I know rationally that I should be kinder to myself. I should give myself time. I should take it one day at a time. But why bother when six months later, this is what's going to happen again?

1jr4jok,offmychest,1743744956.0,"Should I confront my mom about why I resent her so much So I (43M) don’t get along with my mother (73F) overall. this seems to perplex her. i’m wondering if I should explain why in part I resent her so much and have trouble getting along with her or if it’s gonna cause more problems. So a little backstory on our relationship . When I was 13, my parents got divorced. This was no surprise for me or my half sisters. My father and her argued often, and by the time they announced they were getting a divorce they hadn’t slept in the same room in at least 6 months. I know this because she slept on the fold out couch with me since I lost my room to my sister since she couldn’t get along with my other sister. It was a whole disfunctional mess. So after my mom chose to she leave him and she took me along shortly after i turned 13, 1000 miles and an ocean away to Hawaii, which sounds nice, but I had no time with my dad and did not see him for two more years. I was in a new place with a very different culture. One thing I will say that they did well during this process, they never made me feel like it was my fault, but that’s about it with them together. There was no coparenting. When we got off the plane her boyfriend was already there to meet us so I assume that she cheated, though I don’t know the whole details of her relationship before that I know that she went to Hawaii on a solo vacation the summer before we left and she started the divorce process and my understanding is that’s when she met this guy. To say the least this guy was an asshole, manipulative, and verbally abusive at times. They would break up, make up, break up, and make up and I dealt with this my entire junior high and high school career. My mom would shit talk my dad relentlessly,  insult him all the time, and he had no way of defending himself. When I finally did see my dad for the first time in two years, it was for two weeks every summer until I was 18 during those times my dad never said anything bad about my mother. He kept his mouth shut about her and made our visits about us. He bonded with me as much as he could during those small times. That was honestly the greatest gift he ever gave me. But to this day my mom still believes he poisoned me against her. So fast-forward to now over the years my mom has always been pushy, overbearing demanding that we think the way she does about things do y things she wants,  stuff like that. She makes assumptions most of them are fairly minor though such as assuming that she can stay at our place instead of a hotel when she visits, despite limited space, stuff like that. Inserting herself in my decisions about raising my kids etc. There are far worse mothers out there I know.  More importantly she has done many immensely nice things for me and my family. She has supported us both emotionally and financially during very hard times. During the Covid quarantine she watched our kids in Hawaii where she lives because at the time it had some of the lowest rates of the virus and she lived in a very rural area while we continued to work because we were both essential workers. She has been a good grandmother to my kids and part of the reason I don’t tell her all of this directly, despite the arguments we’ve had is because I don’t want them to lose that connection, but it weighs on me. Her kindness many times because of her assumptions feels almost like there are strings attached. She never explicitly says it though. I admit she worked hard to raise me, especially after the divorce. She got herself a masters,  she became a teacher and she worked hard but she didn’t get much time with me, that’s for sure but that’s the fact for many parents. I appreciate the things she’s done for me and yet I have great difficulty letting go of the things that she did wrong. My dad certainly is no saint, their divorce was not one-sided. There were problems and he created a lot, but he’s the only one who’s come to me and apologized for things he might’ve done to me. My mom has never said sorry or reflected back on any of it in a few times we talked about heavy stuff that I felt she did wrong. She always felt very accused and very much like I was overreacting, she is always the persecuted one. She has become a conspiracy theorist  which has torn our relationship more. Our discussions now have become more biting, mostly because of me. She seems to avoid topics and i’ll hint at them and my irritation and disgust with her beliefs. At this point I’m wondering if my mental health and a push for healing would be helped by my telling her all this and trying to confront it in a straightforward and honest way for both of us, I genuinely would prefer to no longer be angry and be able to have a relationship with her, or will this only cause more problems. another part of me would rather cut ties with her and not deal with her anymore And if I should just forgive, how does one go about that.

1jr3zsc,offmychest,1743742876.0,"Frustrated after aggressive language towards my mom Sorry, long time lurker but first time poster. I just needed to write it down for my own sanity.

I (28M) recently moved back home while looking for a new job and have been staying with my mom and step-dad (Both mid 50's) for a few months now until I get back on my feet. I'll preface this by saying we have things going on in our personal lives regarding close family that are adding a bit of stress, so overall tensions are elevated at the moment; it is what it is.

To be frank, this whole interaction was stupid from start to finish; I'll try my best to remember what was said. I was cooking some dinner. My step-dad says (in an annoyed way) ""Hey, why do you need the big burner if you're gonna use a small pot?"" I am the only one cooking anything, so I walk over to put the pasta in, not thinking much about it. My mom replies out of the blue with, ""Why would you wear big underwear if you have a small wiener?"" To which step-dad responds with ""Well, what if I punch you in the fucking face?"" and walked away to go watch TV.

They have been married for almost 20 years. Over that span I've heard my fair share of arguments, disagreements, whatever, to which I would always just ignore. But trust me when I say this did not sound normal. 

My mom communicated that she was quite offended by that and I could tell she was holding back tears. She got zero response back. She apologized to me, saying she was sorry I had to hear that. This was so unexpected I just kind of spaced out for a moment, but after her unnecessary apology to me, the anger rushed in. I wanted to say something immediately but I didn't and I regret that.

She sat down to eat and I sat with her, while he just watched TV. No one said a god damn thing for 20 minutes. When he came back in the kitchen to clean up I just looked at him and said ""hey, that was fucked up, really fucked up. I can't believe you said that."" We just looked at each other for a few seconds and he told me to mind my own fuckin business, and something about my mother's joke beforehand. I wish I would have said more, but I just shook my head. Hey man, I was minding my own business until you talked about punching my mom in the fucking face, while I was standing there. We talked after and she told me she was not OK about the situation, but didn't feel as if she was in any danger.

My mom and dad divorced amicably when I was 1, so I've never known them together as ""parents"" per say, but they've both always been in my life. So I was happy that she had someone when she finally met my step-dad. He helped me with vehicles and jobs when I was a kid, gave me life advice, and helps her maintain a family business they started (this contributes to the stress).

For 20 years I never doubted that he was a positive in my mom's life. But even if they were just in fact words and I'm over reacting, I guess I'm just angry that now there is a doubt. I'm angry that I even had to ask her if she felt safe or not, because before this point, it felt like a stupid question. And I'm saddened that I lost a good amount of respect for someone that I was just chatting and laughing with yesterday. It's weird, part of me doesn't want to be affected by it, but most of me is internally screaming about it.

But maybe I'm just a fortunate guy who hasn't had anything bad really happen to him yet.

1jr3a7e,offmychest,1743740368.0,"I wanna kill myself I feel like today I was cursed. Me and my family are on vacation week. Yesterday we went to the beach. I had so much fun I enjoyed the beach and we rented a boat. Then after all the enjoyment I was holding my phone and I fell in the water. Take note, beach water breaks your phone even if it’s water resistant. anyway I immediately checked to see if my phone still worked snd it did and I searched what I can do cause of course the salt water can damage whatevers inside your phone. It said to get water thats clean and not salty for sure and I did and I rinsed it. It worked properly throughout the day. 
At night me and my boyfriend were chatting, and we argued. I felt horrible going to sleep I just wanted to cry cause we always argue alot and we sleep feeling like pure shit. I woke up at 6am cause we planned to ride the boat again before the sun gets too hot. I prepared and my phone was working absolutely perfectly. We walked to the beach and took some photos on my phone then I had to leave it in the room cause honestly I was alrsady scared to get kt near the water so I left kt to charge in the room too. 
We had fun we laughed we enjoyed we swam and did whatever that made us happy until we were finished and I had to head back to my room just ro find my phones screen flickering. I turned it off immediately and I didnt know what to do. I felt like I was almost panicking because my boyfriend might think I left him or got super mad at him. So I thought maybe theres still water inside or whatever and I told my dad and he said just keep it turned off for 24 hours. I tried to use my moms ipad to text my boyfriend but I cant login to any of my accounts because it needed my phone to proceed. Then I went out to get something only to realize that the sandals I left on the back of our truck foot stand were gone and only one sandal left and I realized my dad used the truck and went somwhere. They were expensive and they had probably fallen somewhere on the road and I told my dad and he said lets find it on the road on the way home. Then we went and tried to find it on the side of the streets and there was no sandal found, it’s getting more horrible. We then just went home and it was a 3 hour drive and I had to drive that long. We decided to stop over a phone repair shop. I went to the shop and I explained and then they diagnosed waht
 Was really wrong. Turned out my LCD or display had been damaged, my camera too, and my speaker. And to get it fixed and actually usable, my mom paid $110. I felt horrible. We also didn’t tell my dad because he’ll get really mad that we spent that much on my phone that we planned on selling before but I didn’t want yet and I feel like I’ll get yelled at anytime or get scolded for my actions. I just want a break.
Now that my phone was fixed the first thing I did was to text my boyfriend. The messages he had sent were a goodmorning and nothing else. I knew I was fucking screwed. I explained to him and he told me he wanted a talk with me when he gets home. I wanna fucking cry everything is horrible. My mom is always mad at me throughout the whole thing and I was just scared and anxious and I just want everything to end.
This may not sound so bad but having narcissistic parents is just so hard to deal with.

1jr34u2,offmychest,1743739856.0,"genuine panic and distress over something recent So, I was in the mood earlier and was cycling through different thoughts to arouse myself. At some point, I randomly remembered something from when I was 12—this moment where I had asked a friend if I could carry-hug her, and she said no(i was a weird kid). I didn’t think much of it at the time, but for some reason, that memory popped into my head.

At first, I was just going with it, and i thought of things surrounding that when arousing myself but then I started worrying that it might be weird. I changed my thoughts before finishing, but now I’m freaking out because I realized that in my head, I still pictured myself as 12 in the memory. Later in the thought, I thought of someone else—someone I know now but didn’t know when I was 12. I wasn’t really thinking about their age at all, but since I was picturing myself as 12, I’m scared that I accidentally imagined them at the same age, even though that wasn’t my focus at all.

I also wasn’t attracted to the age itself—just the action and situation. But now my brain is spiraling, making me second-guess everything, and I don’t know how to feel about it. I keep thinking, **“Did I do something bad? Does this mean something awful about me?”**

Someone told me that our brains can sometimes revert to younger versions of ourselves in vulnerable moments, especially if a memory triggers a familiar feeling. They also said that if someone had an intimate experience when they were younger, recalling it later wouldn’t mean they’re attracted to that age, just that they’re remembering how they felt at the time. That made sense, but I’m still panicking. what if i jacked it to a 12yo?

I tried to make her get an abortion, but at the end of the day it’s her body and she chose to keep it - there’s really nothing I can do about that. I already told my parents, and I got some pretty mixed reactions. Currently we’re discussing where to keep the baby (which country) and it turns out my country is a much friendlier place when it comes to childcare (healthcare, government support etc.) but that also means that, for a time, my girlfriend won’t be able to help me take care of our baby. I’m basically going to be a single dad until we find a way to move in together. My parents are both there to support me, but still… damn.

Eventually, I had a really bad day, and my main boss, (who was really the only one who would yell) yelled at me to clock out and go home. I just lowered my head, and shuffled away. On my way to the breakroom, I picked up a chef's knife, and starting slashing at my arm with tears streaming down my face. Blood was dripping down my arm as I turned to leave. No one noticed, and I went out the door. But before I completely left, I went to my other manager, and confessed. It was obvious he didn't know how to handle something like this, both professionally and personally. He took me to the manager office, handed me a band aid, and told another manager of a different area of business in the restaurant, who I know personally and is a family friend. I left, and came back the next day like nothing had happened. My main manager, who was the one that yelled, never found out that I cut myself, and only just found out a month ago that I had a ""breakdown"" after one of his fits. The manager I showed my cuts to told him recently, but understandably left out the detail of the self harm. A few weeks ago, that manager transferred to a different location. I believe I few waitresses found out about it, but as far as I know, it was never spoken of again. The boss who yelled really likes me now, and I never get in trouble anymore, other than just the occasional small correction or reminder. But I still hate him. And I still cut myself, but not as frequently. Truthfully, it is mainly loneliness that does it. I started high school at the same time as the pandemic, so I switched to online school and never made any girlfriends (or regular friends). I just want to hold someone. I just want to feel cared about by somebody different.

1jr1j49,offmychest,1743734628.0,"They turned the sun into a shadow. I was only a child. They laughed when I cried.
They silenced me when I tried to speak.
They waved me off like I was just stubborn.
“You’re only fifteen.”
As if fifteen didn’t already carry the weight of seven years of bullying,
a continent-sized move,
a crushed childhood,
and a heart trying to rebuild itself from broken pieces.



School taught me to stay quiet.
I was the weird one.
The ""nobody.""
The one they whispered about, laughed at,
mocked openly like I didn’t exist — even when they stared straight into my eyes.
I was there, and invisible at the same time.

Once, I asked:
“Why do you treat me like this?”
They said:
“Because you’re you.”
Not the name — the me inside the name.

I didn’t even know it was bullying.
When a day passed without humiliation, I thought:
“Maybe I have a chance to be their friend.”


At home?
It wasn’t much different.
“Now I get why no one likes you at school,”
my parents would say when we fought.

And when my sister screamed so loud the neighbors could hear,
I tried to cover her mouth. I almost choked her.
Out of panic. Out of fear.
My dad came home and beat me until I couldn’t lie down.
My mom quietly treated my wounds.

They demanded my phone to “check something.”
They scrolled. Judged. Controlled.
When I spoke, they didn’t look up from their screens.



And when I started thinking differently — when I tried to talk,
when I questioned what I believed after a lifetime in church —
they blamed my friend.
“She’s changed you.”
No. I changed me.

I built myself out of wreckage.
I made my voice out of silence.
I grew out of pain.
And they want to give the credit to someone else.


I played piano for years. I have awards.
First place. Laureate.
And now? I have stage fright. Panic attacks.
But that doesn’t matter.
“Play in church — or lose your phone.”

They say, “You play beautifully.”
But it’s too late.
I became a perfectionist. A self-doubter.
They turned the sun into a shadow.


They say, “Forget that place. What’s done is done.”
But how can I forget?
That’s not just a place. That’s my skin. My memory. My trauma.
My childhood was built on pain.
This isn’t a phase. This is a life survived.


Now, I try to speak. To explain. To be heard.
But they call it stubbornness.
They tell me I’ll get to choose “when I get married.”
They say they take me seriously — and then dismiss every word.

I speak carefully now.
Every word filtered.
Because I learned — if you speak wrong,
you get hurt.

I used to be direct. Blunt. Honest.
They said I was “too much.”
They didn’t see the pain behind the sharpness.
No one did.


I was a background character in my own life.
Ignored. Rejected. Betrayed.
Always the second choice — if I was chosen at all.

Now, I’m learning to live. To speak.
To rebuild. To unlearn the pain.
To light the fire again.
To be real. Not perfect. Not good. Just real.


I’m not here for pity.
I just want you to know:

1jr1gt8,offmychest,1743734426.0,"I feel conflicted about my marriage Hey everyone,



I’m feeling really conflicted right now, and I just need to get some of this off my chest. Lately, I’ve been increasingly detached from my wife. Even though she tries to be light-hearted and connect, I can’t shake this heavy feeling of obligation that’s replacing the genuine joy I once felt. I miss the person I used to be—the part of me that was free, spontaneous, and truly alive.



These days, even my early morning drives, which used to clear my mind, now leave me feeling empty. I keep getting overwhelmed by thoughts of Raye—someone with whom I once felt truly seen, heard, and appreciated. It’s a stark contrast to the numbness and confinement I experience in my marriage right now.



I’m caught in a really painful conflict. On one hand, I deeply care about my wife and the vows we made. On the other, I’m drawn to a sense of freedom that feels completely out of reach at the moment. The constant pressure of responsibilities and the burnout that comes with them have left me feeling like I’ve lost my identity. Even small things—like the urge to check my phone or the worry about missing a text—remind me of the constraints I feel, making it hard to be present even when I’m physically with her.



I’m struggling to understand whether this overwhelming disconnection is just burnout and depression, or if it’s a sign of a deeper loss of connection in my marriage. The guilt from these conflicting emotions is crushing, and the thought of initiating a difficult conversation with my wife fills me with dread. I feel torn between the pain of losing a piece of myself and the fear of hurting someone I once loved so deeply.



Has anyone else experienced something like this?

1jr142h,offmychest,1743733307.0,"I’m worried I am incapable of romantic love because I didn’t receive it for most of my life. I’m 22F. When I was younger, basically up to age 19, I was really ugly. Overweight, short hair I didn’t take care of, no makeup, dressed weird, glasses, acne, gap teeth. Why I did that? I don’t fucking know and I regret it a lot. 

Like every other teen girl, I had crushes on people, some that to me felt like falling in love (butterflies, sparks, wanting to be around them, thinking abt them a lot, etc) although it was not reciprocated. I never heard about someone even having a crush on me, and my friends would even make comments about “not being able to imagine me in a relationship” By 16 I was well aware nobody has, had, or would have a crush on me as I was. I resigned myself to knowing that I was not going to have a teen love story, and repressed any crushes I would have, not entertaining the idea. I also had a lot of traumatic shit happen during my childhood (poverty, parent death, borderline negligent/abusive parents, mental health shit) if that makes a difference.

The last few years I’ve had a glow up. I’ve lost about 70lbs and now am at a healthy weight, grew out my hair, learnt how to dress properly, clear skin. I don’t get hit on or anything but on dating apps I do quite well, and I’ve had one relationship through an app and am now in one currently. 

My first relationship was 2 years, I loved that person a lot. As a friend. In the beginning I had what felt like “love” but soon enough I had the unshakable feeling I was going to break up with them, and I wouldn’t really fantasize about being with them for the unforeseeable future,  in fact I would fantasize about being single. We definitely had a bond, and I loved them so much as a person, but it felt like to me like a strong friendship, and I actually put off breaking up with them for a long time because I didn’t want to lose my best friend (I’m awful I know) even though I knew I didn’t love them romantically. I think if I did, I would know. Despite our strong bond, and the fact that I was treated amazingly, I never felt “in love”. At the beginning I would relate to love songs/book romances but it dissipated. I couldn’t relate to my friends that were in love.

Since then I’ve gone out on dates with guys. And they’ve been great, no red flags, checking off every box. But I felt nothing with them. 

I have a boyfriend now of about a month. Again, he’s been perfect. Treats me like a princess. I am attracted to him, and I like hanging out, but not all the time. I don’t feel like I even have a crush on him. I don’t feel like we even connect, which my last relationship at least had. When I listen to love songs or see romances in movies/books, I am just reminded of a sensation I’ve never felt, and it eats away at me an embarrassing amount. I can’t feel that crush sensation I had since I was a young teen.

I don’t know why I am like this. I feel kind of broken, and it makes me feel sick to have to let down these guys that I’m sure any girl would be dying to have. I know I’m going to have to break up with my boyfriend soon. I’m self-aware enough to know I have an avoidant attachment style, so I’ve pushed through the relationship thinking that I just have to get over the walls I have built, but I can’t keep going like this, feeling guilty whenever I see him and fantasizing about experiencing a “real love.” Some people say avoidantly attached people don’t feel butterflies and should instead feel safe and calm. I feel safe with him, but not calm, anxious in fact, worrying that I do not feel “love”, imagining the day I meet someone and feel a spark.


I just want to experience falling in love. I want a connection so badly, and I know this stems from spending basically my entire formative years knowing nobody would like me. But now that I am “attractive” and can get these amazing guys I have always wanted, I’m worried that my low self esteem and trauma growing up has seriously damaged me. I remember a teacher in highschool telling me that teenagers experience a different, stronger, and more intense form of romantic love that  adults do not due to their developing brains. I never had that. People also say that when you experience young love, it’s an essential learning experience or milestone that helps you form attachments in the future. That your brain is developing as someone who knows they are loved.

1jr0pkn,offmychest,1743732080.0,"I'm going to become a less clingy girlfriend. Posting this for accountability - sharing this will make me more likely to act on it. Also, I am kind of upset about the situation, so venting helps. I am already feeling a lot more positive about the situation though now that I have a plan.

I, 24F, am an overly clingy girlfriend. I love physical affection, spending quality 1-2-1 time together, sex, and deep conversations. Admittedly, it is very difficult these days to get this. I think I am a bit too much for him - I think I expect him to be more affectionate, touchy, sexual etc. than is realistic and I think he's pulled away because of how I am. You see, we have a bit of a dead bedroom problem. I'm a bit of a freak, really, and I think I make it too obvious. I'm always trying to be sexy sending cheeky texts, wearing lingerie randomly, saying how I'd like to dominate him (he's into femdom so I try and cater to that) but he's not interested and even prefers porn, lol. This applies to pretty much everything else. I honestly think I overdo stuff. I'm too huggy, talk too much, blah blah. I literally will sit next to him, doing nothing, waiting for him to finish doom scrolling on tiktok. You get the point.

So, from now on, I will be investing more in myself. I will be less clingy. No more trying to be awkwardly flirty. No more waiting around for a conversation to occur. I will be spending more time on my own. I will pick up extra shifts at work. When I get home I will finally complete video games that I've been meaning to complete. I will focus on my clay making hobbies. I will be having fun practicing new eyeshadow looks. I will go out for walks more as I need to get more exercise in anyway.

1jqzfbm,offmychest,1743728139.0,"I think I almost got kidnapped twice in my life. Nothing deeply traumatic. Just the ""what if"" has been on my mind lately. 

The first time I was a kid and I was following my mom at a basketball game. I think we were going to the restroom. Everyone was in the stands watching the game. A man grabbed my waist from the back with his two hands but I quickly turned around before he picked me up. He was a young guy. He was sweating. He looked deeply panicked and said sorry to me multiple times. I remember how scared he looked. Like he wanted to cry. I can't get this moment out of my head even as an adult. I would think even if his daughter or little sister was wearing the exact same hat and outfit as me, he would just grab my arm to get my attention. Right? I wasn't a toddler that was just running around. And I was not young enough to be getting picked up still at that point. 

The second time, I was walking to the pet store alone. This time I was a teenager. An extremely expensive looking yellow car followed me. I went closer to the back of the building where shipments come in. He rolled his window down and asked me if I wanted a ride. I said no. He did not seem genuine in his concerns. I don't remember why he left, I just remember him being there longer than he should have been there. I do know there was snow on the ground and he might have had trouble getting his car closer to me and that my ass kept moving after I said no.  

Sure I can give these men the benefit of the doubt. I don't know what would've happened. I don't know the truth. I just know it felt wrong. 

It just feels so eerie to me that I might have dodged a horrible fate twice and thought nothing of it until I became an adult. What if he managed to pick me up? What if I got in that car?

1jqz4r4,offmychest,1743727249.0,"I was knowingly the affair partner and destroyed a marriage When I was 22 at my first job, I had an affair with my direct supervisor at work. He was 12 years older. He was married with 2 young children. I met his whole family at company parties and events and was cordial with them. The wife was also 12 years older, and took a liking to me. Said I reminded her of herself when she was still working.

It doesn't matter but he came onto me first, most likely because I was flirting with him so very obviously. I wanted him and he could tell. I lost my virginity to him. He was known to have visited brothels overseas and strip clubs regularly and somehow, I never got any STDs from him. I didn't care at the time though. I was so in love with him, I would have done anything. Literally anything. I was blinded, obsessed, and completely devoted. He could have told me anything and I would have believed him.

He asked for a lot of nude pictures which I willingly sent. He also taped our sexual activities. I didn't want to, but you didn't see me refusing. He wanted to do a lot of dominating stuff with me which I also allowed.

We were completely reckless at work. Everyone picked up on what was going on and I was a social pariah. People were exceptionally cruel and rude towards me, which I fully deserved. Over the period of a year, he became more and more possessive and abusive towards me. He hit and grabbed me regularly, but we were also doing very rough stuff in the bedroom so it kind of became mixed and blended in my mind. The bruises were indistinguishable. He became extremely controlling, jealous, and paranoid that I'd cheat on him, even though he was the one cheating on his wife with me. I never cheated on him. I was too in love.

The end came when his wife discovered the videos on his phone. He never hid or deleted them. He was also very reckless. His wife slapped him, confronted him for hours, threatened to make the videos public. He let me know what happened, and commanded me to stay locked in my apartment. I don't have memories of this time anymore. It's just a black mark in my mind.

I also don't know the details of this part but I think management at work was alerted somehow. I was let go. He was not. I contemplated lots of extreme actions which I won't write. I can't fully express or convey how guilty, ashamed, horrified, disgusted I was. There will never be words. Nothing will ever be enough. I never felt like I was cool or hot or interesting for my deeds. Even throughout the relationship, I felt disgusted. When he hit me, I accepted it because I knew I deserved it, in karma, punishment, whatever. I still deserve it.

She threatened to release the videos online a couple of times, which would paralyze me for weeks. I walked around in a daze. The videos only showed my face and his junk, not his face. She had enough mercy on me to not actually do it. I am eternally ashamed and eternally grateful. But there is always the possibility. This was a time when revenge porn sites were still up and I'd look through them regularly to see if mine were on there. It was horrifying but I couldn't look away. I had to find my video.

We ""broke up"" but stayed in contact, as he updated me on his wife's condition and whether or not they'd be divorcing, and whether she'd put the videos up. I was an absolute mess, alcoholic, self-harming, and had a one night stand with a friend. I told him the truth about this. That night he came over and beat me, and strangled me. I just accepted it all. He said he wouldn't kill a sinner. Something like that. I just remember my vision fading away as I was against the wall and thinking, ""so this is how it ends. My family is going to be so sad."" But he let me go.

I don't even know how it all faded off but it did. He contacted me again a few years later, clearly wanting to just hook up while he was in town. I refused. I spent the next couple years dealing with severe bulimia. He never got divorced.

I regret my actions to this day. The experience changed me fundamentally as a person. I know now that I have no right to judge anyone for anything. I am humbled entirely. I have been to therapy, but no amount of therapy can make me fully forgive myself. I've never hurt another person so deeply before in my life, and while I have no idea what she thinks of me today, it doesn't matter because I can't and will not forgive myself. I've stopped self-harming and I'm no longer an alcoholic or bulimic. I obviously don't fuck with married people anymore. But I'll always have a part of myself that is guilty, ashamed, and disgusted. This won't change, and I consider it my own punishment. I've gotten in other bad abusive relationships after this, and I accepted that as well. Because I deserve it.

I know this attitude doesn't help anyone and it doesn't reverse my actions and it doesn't help her or him or the kids or anything at all. It doesn't matter. I deserve to suffer at least a little, all the time. No insults can hurt me more than how much I hurt myself. What I did will haunt me for eternity. I was never proud. I never thought I should be excused or forgiven. I committed an offense that's possibly as bad as premeditated murder, except there is no actual law for what I did. I broke a moral, spiritual law. I caused an unspeakable wound to her and her family. There is no excuse, no nothing I can do. That's the worst part.

1jqxt0d,offmychest,1743723471.0,"I wish I could say this to my ex. So my ex is someone I dated 10 coming up to 11 years ago when I was 18. I knew through my friend circles that he had gotten into a relationship a couple of years ago however at the time I was a few years into my current relationship. I moved on however my ex was my first love/ first young love.

However I found his reddit post last week and saw two post one tagged to relationship advise about his fresh ex was texting him and how he should deal with it and the other one that kind of tugged my heart strings called lost and lonely. 

I went though the reddit post lost and lonely of him talking about how it had been at the time it was 2 months since the break up, how he was left with a house that should of been there home, how he felt he had no friends or close family to support him in his dark time and how all he dose is sleep but is luckly he has a dog to get him out the house. 

It's was weird to me because I went through a phase where my teenage-self, she ravelded in his pain.But then moments later my I wanted to reach out just to make sure he was fully okay. I put my phone down and went to sleep however the next day I found myself writing a small story about 2 people meeting on the beach who knew eachother years ago, they sat on a bench and just talked to eachother about there life's, how she had just got her license to drive, a promotion in her job and moved out of her mother's home years ago and got a small flat with her bf untill they could work out away for a house. The fella would talk about his life how he changed jobs, got his new dog and talk about how he meet and fell in love with someone new only to be deal with the breakup, talking about his currently feelings, they heal eachother befor going there separate ways in life again.

I realised how deep down I just by this story I wanted to reach out as a friend just send a message to check on him befor carrying on my own life again however I realise how stupid it would be as he is a chapter in my life that's long passed. 

However if he saw this post I would say

Hey A, 
I seen your post and it broke my heart alittle bit for you. I hope you took some of the comments advice to look after yourself and join some walking groups. It's daunting being in our 30s trying to make new friends, trust me I was in the position 2 year ago when I joined a girls only group in town, however I made some new friends I can trust and have had a laugh with. I honestly hope you find the same ❤️ I'm happy you see a therapist also, you never took me for one to ever seek therapy but I'm happy you did and they will do you some good as time gose on. 
I hope you always know deep down you have a friend at your side spiritually but I kinda hope we do end up like the story where we just run into eachother one day sit down and have a cuppa and chat. No romance just two people who were once in love with eachother talking about there life's, probly taking the mick out of eachother. 
I honestly hope your okay but I know you are.

1jqwq7y,offmychest,1743720573.0,"I just can't handle this anymore The past few years of my life have just been so terrible, and I honestly feel like I'm starting to crack now. I just can't keep comforting my mom anymore. Every day is another day of endless sobbing and crying. My Dad cheated on my mom and it changed everything for my family. It made me realize how much of a terrible person he was. He's just...abandoned us. 

For two years now we've had to deal with this, and yet the divorce still hasn't happened. Mom says it will in months, dad needs to turn in papers, claims he already did. A new terrible thing every day. We needed a new car. Got one and the new one is totally shit and needs tons of repairs costing money we don't have. My mom has a TBI and literally can't work. My dad keep saying she can work. He refuses to pay the bills.. He bought a house in Spain to cheat on my mom with, and after years it finally sold and made nothing, and my dad's hid money in accounts in Spain and Switzerland. She's sobbing right now and I just can't handle this anymore. 

I fucking hate my empathy right now. I want to tell her it'll be all right, but it won't. My dad's not here so I just feel like screaming at my mom, telling her to shut up and stop crying, but I know that's wrong, and that feeling is really directed toward my dad. My mom has done nothing wrong, but I just can't fucking handle the sobbing anymore. I fucking hate the fucking sobbing I want to die every time i hear it. We are doomed. We have no money. My dad is holding my mom in contempt of court ( don't know what that means) for random crap like trading the old car to help pay for the new one, saying it was much more expensive. Bullshit.  It was a piece of crap. 

My younger brother is fucking moron who constantly argues with her, and he's been doing this for years and I fucking hate him. She doesn't deserve this. The stress is going to kill her. When she gets stressed she gets absent seizures, but who knows if one of those my kill her or if she'll do it herself. My older brother is a leech, an adult who should be doing more, but still acts like a child. Maybe that's the bipolar disorder that he refuses to treat, but he's out of work and living with us and treats her like shit and she can't order him to go because she's afraid of what he'll say and do and where his own daughter will go.  My sister is the only good sibling, but even she's scarred in her own way, having to mature a lot faster than other girls her age. 

I want to do something, literally anything. I wish there was some fucking magic spell I could do to fix this absolute hell. Every day my mom gets closer and closer to a complete mental breakdown and I just can't handle it. A part of me wants her to die because then she won't be in anymore pain, but that sounds just so evil and terrible. I just can't handle this crap anymore.

1jqwl6a,offmychest,1743720204.0,"I tried to kill my abusive parents when I was a kid I shared this story with my close friends once before and they turned me away immediately. They told people at school about it. About how everyone goes through bad things but they don’t hurt people. They said I was going to do something bad again one day.

I don’t tell people anymore. All they hear is that I tried to kill my parents when I was very young. But they never think to wonder why a four year old child would feel like violence is their only option. After hearing the first bit, nobody listens further. 

My parents didn’t want kids. My mom was a drug addict starting at age 15 and my dad was raised by South Korean immigrants- their relationship was rocky and he spent all of this time outside the home. He never learned anything and ended up getting stuck in construction work. While he was working, my mom would invite her drug dealer over and she would have sex with him in return for pain killers. This guy was very aggressive and I would stay away from him. He’d threaten my dad when he came home. My mom once told him that her drug dealer has a gun and that he’s “a good person to know” . I read all this is custody papers. She’s go to parties and stay gone for days. Once she fell asleep on the couch so I left the apartment and wandered across the street. To this day it’s a relief I just ran into other toddlers playing in their yard. My dad was furious with my mom for continually failing to be better for me. He’d come home and find bent spoons in the dishwasher and I’d be unfed and dirty. As a baby my grandparents who looked after me didn’t take care of me, I spend all my time in a room in the basement, no diaper changes, no food, no checkups, nothing. My grandma would make racist remarks basically saying that whatever they fed me was better than what my dad’s mother could provide.

I stayed in multiple women’s homes with my mom when I was a toddler (this was around when the frozen movie came out) it was Christmas time and a random guy at the home gave me a frozen themed notebook. When we went back to the apartment and the custody battle began I couldn’t take it anymore being with my mom. People wonder how I could have done something to her, but I didn’t see her as my mom. She was just some woman that kept me from having a fulfilled life. I figured if I didn’t get rid of her now then we would never be happy. I wanted it to just be me and my dad. I saw potential in him, we could be happy. 

I put lavender scented chemicals into her mug. I watched her drink it from the doorway. She cringed at the taste and spit it back out, that’s when she noticed me. She laughed at me for being silly, patted my head and left the room. I was so disappointed. I felt like I failed. Eventually my dad did win custody and I lived with him. And he didn’t live up to my expectations either. One evening when I was in third grade, I was struggling with some math homework (I am terrible at math to this day) and he got so angry I didn’t understand. Whenever he was angry my brain short circuits and I can’t escape his questioning. This happened today as well.

He punched the glass kitchen table and it shattered all over my legs. I was crying so hard- because that’s when I knew both my parents had failed. I was never going to have what other kids had, I was never going to live in a nice house, I was never going be feel comfortable. 

A few years later, I learned that a specific kind of cherry pits are dangerous in large amounts so I crushed the pits up into a fine paste and split them into a brownie my dad hadn’t eaten jet. I don’t remember if either of these moments were methodical and planned or impulsive- same day choices. But my dad ended up throwing the brownie away because it was old. 

I don’t think about my dads much, but I’m always haunted by what I did to my mom. Mostly because that’s what I told my friends that day and the way they judged me still haunts me, almost more than the act itself. I let it get to me so much, I spent like two years of school just flunking every class because I was lost in my head wondering if the awful person they’re describing is really me. I can’t describe the emotions I’ve felt over the years in this one post. But I want whoever’s reading this to know that I don’t want to be a bad person. This year there was a school shooting (it turned out to be a prank call but we had no idea) and I had a Swiss Army knife ready to go tucked under my arm.  I felt that if I needed to I was ready to kill the shooter, or at least try to. 

My boyfriend makes me feel like who I was supposed to be all along, I’m calm and happy  for the most part when I’m around him. And I will chase a life like that until I achieve it. Many years ago I followed a kid in my neighborhood with a small pocket knife just to see how I would feel, if my friends were right. The kid eventually noticed me after a long time and I felt sick. Looking back I displayed all the warning signs for a teen murderer or upcoming serial killer. But after I met my boyfriend and experienced some other deeply traumatic events that just knocked the wind out of me.. I just didn’t feel like that anymore. Sometimes I get periods where I feel similar to that but nothing to the extreme. I have no access to therapy but I see a bright future for myself. I’m moving abroad to the country side with my boyfriend, I’ll study something I like and build a comfy life I’ve always needed.

I had to leave home and can never come back or else face a significant risk to my life. this is one of the most difficult moments of my life my dad is a malignant narcissist with violent tendencies and I guess I asserted my autonomy too much

Honestly idk what to do.

i snuck out and can't tell them my location lol. Things have been escalating fast with my dad. I’ve been stupidly confronting him, as the scapegoat in my family, and he’s been furious at losing control. He posed me as serverly mentally unwell to my mom to discredit me and one nigh, he made me fear for my life. So I left.

I then told my gf abt this, said I needed help, said I had no money, nowhere to go, and feared for my life. Instead of providing any sense of comfort, she told me she didn’t care and broke up with me. She was all o had left. She blocked me. Then she texted me back, and apologized, but she said she can’t be my gf anymore.

I don’t know what to tell my mom. She has CPTSD, is terrified of my dad, and has extreme anxiety. I’ve been gone for 2 days. Honestly don’t know where to go or what to do.

1jqvulq,offmychest,1743718264.0,"Years later, I still think about someone I had a falling out with. There’s a woman I met in my 20s who I’ve never quite been able to forget.

We were close friends, maybe something a bit more. There was always this unspoken tension, the kind of connection that feels like it’s almost something. I had feelings for her, but I never said anything. I don’t even fully know why. Maybe fear, maybe the inexperience stupid young me. We had a fallout over a misunderstanding, and that was the end of us. We stopped talking.

A couple of years later, I reached out. I wanted to fix things. She didn’t want to reconnect. That hurt, but I understood.

Then, a few years after that, she reached out. And this time, I didn’t respond. I don’t know if it was pride, or hurt, or the fact that by then I had tried to bury the whole thing. But I let the moment pass. And just like that, we missed each other again.

Now, more years have passed. I’m in my late 30s. She’s married. We’ve both built separate lives. And yet she still crosses my mind. Not every day, but often enough. I think about what could have been, or more often, what wasn't. The missed timing. The silence. The friendship we lost.

I don’t want to interfere with her life. I’m not looking to rekindle anything. I just want to stop carrying this lingering sense of unfinished business and regret. I want to move forward. I want to let go but some part of me still hasn’t.

I miss the friendship. I miss what we had. I miss what we never had.  
Sometimes I blame myself for being immature at the time and I hate that I still carry this with me.

Just needed to say this out loud to strangers. Maybe that helps. Maybe not. But thanks for reading if you made it this far.

**TL;DR:** I’m in my late 30s and still haven’t fully let go of someone I was close to in my 20s. I had feelings, never acted on them, fell out over a misunderstanding.

1jqvl2m,offmychest,1743717610.0,"How Porn, Cybersex, & Gooning Ruined My Relationship. I don’t want to make this post too long, but really want to vent so will try and keep it snappy. 

But for at least 6 years I have been in complete denial of how porn has ruined me, and to what extent. 

I have bad depression & anxiety. To the point where I feel extremely uncomfortable to leave the house, get groceries, driving, etc. 

In 2018 my mom committed suicide, and I began isolating more. I lived by myself during this time and spent all day, everyday inside. Talked to friends less. Spent more time online. Got more depressed from the grief. Told myself almost verbatim “if I don’t have the balls to kill myself, I’ll do it with porn and junk food.” Started binging fast food, weed, and porn. 

At some point, decide it’s time to get better. Start cleaning up. I get a cat and move to a new place. 

Start feeling confident to date on Tinder. Match with the most perfect woman I’ve ever met. 

Things are great, albeit they start slow. We fall in love. But I start watching porn again as depression creeps back up, fast. 

Find “gooning” servers on discord. Start downloading thousands of files and chatting with other gooners. Become on a mission to be the #1 feeder (someone who shares porn in the server / DMs for others to masturbate to.) 

I get addicted to cybersex / feeding. Sending porn to men (and one woman) and jerking off together. Usually they would do it on cam, mic, or text. I would type, even roleplay sometimes. 

Girlfriend finds this and she’s devastated. Repeated lying on my end, excuses, and not coming to the terms with the fact of it all: I CHEATED. 

I was addicted, depressed, and selfish. Anyone else have experience with these servers and “feeding”? 

If you love your girlfriend don’t ever do it. Now we’re broken up. Probably for good, and I think that’s for the better. I have an appointment with a therapist on Friday.

In that process, I also realized I have aphantasia (the inability to picture things, grasping obscure concepts it very difficult).

I also can’t really look back at past events in full detail and it’s really sad. I just feel like I can’t really experience things fully.

1jqveo0,offmychest,1743717171.0,"Hoarding isn’t like it is on TV 
Growing up with a hoarder is so surreal. As an adult I went through a phase where i convinced myself where it didn’t affect me at all and I shouldn’t care because “people had it worse.” 
Now as an adult in my late 20s I see how bad it messed with my head. Memories of my old childhood house. With piles of things untouched and unmoved. I know there are drawers and cabinets to this day I never opened and knew what was truly in there because I couldn’t even open them. Let alone get to them! The smell is unreal of things wet that didn’t dry properly. Moth balls. Can’t throw anything away. Mom will notice. Even pull it out of the trash. I’ll get another hit for trying to throw it away. Sorry. 
Losing heat in the 1st grade due to my family not wanting anyone in the house. Learning to shower cold and use an electric skillet for all my meals. Going to a motel only during the winter to take hot showers and have heat but only on weekends. Seeing that motel years later tore down making my heart hurt a little. Learning to keep clean with baby wipes so I didn’t have to shower in cold water. 
Sharing a bed with my mother till I was maybe 10. Then the living room floor was all mine. Layered blankets in the floor for my bed and I still know to this day how to make it the most comfortable to sleep. My favorite are comforters to this day. They stay cool and fluffy longer. 
Remembering my mom’s room having piles..on piles of clothes taller than me as a child to where she would tell me. “Climb over that and grab this for me.” Clothes from even before I was born. Never touched again. I knew the best hiding spots of course. Behind the piles and under them. But no other kid had those in their house. Having a room in the house that could have been my room! But the door was closed shut due to the amount of..stuff shoved in there. I remember a restroom I never got to see because the walkway was stacked higher than me to this day. Closet doors shoved open staring at me at night with the fear of dark monsters waiting to get to me. But I couldn’t close the doors to protect myself. 
There was a walk way I made that let you go to every room without stepping on something! I remember every step. I wonder why I can never have friends over..
Oh well got a new house! It only took a year.. remaking a new walk way. I know there’s a freezer in one room stocked with meat. It’s been maybe 5-7 years since it was last opened. I’m scared to ever see it opened. I can’t use the stove. Oh our fridge broke but we can’t get a new one. Can’t get it in. All that food is going bad. Don’t open it. I haven’t since I left that house. 
I learned to keep my clothes in trash bags to stay away from the bugs. Bed bugs. Small moths. Ants. And even some I never figured out. 
I don’t own anything from my childhood. I wish I had my stuffed animals but those are lost. I to this day can’t even throw away the smaller thing I don’t need. Maybe I can keep it? No. It’s useless. What about that shirt I got years ago? It has holes. But if I throw it away, I’ll hurt that persons feelings who gave it to me. Why can’t I even throw away this stupid paper from years ago without crying.

1jquze2,offmychest,1743716130.0,"I had the best sex of my life last night and I don't know how to be normal about it (39M)I had never before in my life hooked up with someone I didn't know. But last night I took a chance, because I'm single & going through second puberty & turning 40 this year & I have never had a partner who actually cared enough about what I wanted in bed to remember anyway. So I thought: fine, what the hell. I'll go fuck a complete stranger I've barely even talked to because we're both horny right now & see what happens! If I get murdered then at least I don't have to deal with, you know, *gestures at the current state of the US*

And what happened was that it was fucking incredible?? 

Like no joke the first time I came I immediately lost track of how many times I came because there was no mind left in my brain to count with. Just orgasm after orgasm (and a quite frankly embarrassing amount of screaming). 

It wasn't just the orgasms either (although HOLY SHIT the orgasms, I think I fucking ascended a couple of times). I'm not going to go into detail bc this isn't the kind of sub for that but suffice to say that there were a lot of firsts for me and they ALL felt better than I could have imagined. And it utterly destroyed me, in the best possible sense. 

But also in the worst possible sense, because I think that in my oxytocin drunk state I may have fucked up the possibility of ever seeing this guy again by being weird about it. I may have actually said the words ""I'm good I just had the best sex of my life and I'm trying not to be clingy about it"" when he asked if I was ok 😭

Like we had explicitly talked about not wanting anything deeper than sex so I was desperately trying to be normal about how amazing I felt & how very much I would like to do that kind of thing again sometime. One of my problems, like, in general, is that I have *no fucking clue how to be normal.*

The other problem last night was that I had seriously come so hard and so much that my body wouldn't stop shaking & some part of my brain was like, ""this shaking will only go away if I get to be little spoon for a while."" So even though I could tell he wanted me to continue getting ready to go home I asked if he could hold me for five minutes. 

I have no idea what normal hookup etiquette is about spooning but we were already clothed again, so if there had ever been a natural moment for it that moment had long since passed. So it was incredibly awkward that I asked and I felt pathetic for even asking. 

As much as it confused and embarrassed me at the time I'm glad that he refused. Just. Big yikes, past me! If you wanted to convince the guy who just gave you the best orgasms you've had in your life that you would be a cool person to meet up with occasionally to have more, similarly mind blowing sex in the future? This was not the fucking way 😭

Afterwards, as I was driving home, I remembered the term ""oxytocin bonding"" and was suddenly extremely glad the guy declined to cuddle.

I feel so fucking stupid! Because he seems like a really interesting person aside from the amazing sex & I was enjoying learning more about him.

To be clear: I super do not want an actual relationship right now! I am enjoying being single very very much (fuck, I love not sharing my bed when it's time to sleep). But it would have been nice to exchange numbers & maybe meet up every month or so - I honestly don't know if I could physically or emotionally handle an experience like last night more often than that. But I made it weird and now I'll probably never hear from him again 😭",best sex life last night dont know normal mi never life hooked someone didnt know last night took chance im single going second puberty turning year never partner actually cared enough wanted bed remember anyway thought fine hell ill go fuck complete stranger ive barely even talked horny right see happens get murdered least dont deal know gestures current state us happened fucking incredible like joke first time came immediately lost track many times came mind left brain count orgasm orgasm quite frankly embarrassing amount screaming wasnt orgasms either although holy shit orgasms think fucking ascended couple times im going go detail bc isnt kind sub suffice say lot firsts felt better could imagined utterly destroyed best possible sense also worst possible sense think oxytocin drunk state may fucked possibility ever seeing guy weird may actually said words im good best sex life im trying clingy asked ok like explicitly talked wanting anything deeper sex desperately trying normal amazing felt much would like kind thing sometime one problems like general fucking clue normal problem last night seriously come hard much body wouldnt stop shaking part brain like shaking go away get little spoon even though could tell wanted continue getting ready go home asked could hold five minutes idea normal hookup etiquette spooning already clothed ever natural moment moment long since passed incredibly awkward asked felt pathetic even asking much confused embarrassed time im glad refused big yikes past wanted convince guy gave best orgasms youve life would cool person meet occasionally similarly mind blowing sex future fucking way afterwards driving home remembered term oxytocin bonding suddenly extremely glad guy declined cuddle feel fucking stupid seems like really interesting person aside amazing sex enjoying learning clear super want actual relationship right enjoying single much fuck love sharing bed time sleep would nice exchange numbers maybe meet every month honestly dont know could physically emotionally handle experience like last night often made weird ill probably never hear,35,461,Positive,Low Concern

Guy 1 (The Stable Option):
	•	I met him a couple of months ago, and he’s made it clear he’s looking for something serious—marriage, stability, and a future together.
	•	He’s willing to invest in me, support my business, get me a car, and help me with a job.
	•	He’s okay with waiting for sex until marriage, and he’s very committed.
	•	But I don’t feel attracted to him. I feel uncomfortable and irritated when we’re together. There’s no chemistry, no excitement. I honestly dread spending time with him.

Guy 2 (The One I Really Like):
	•	I met him recently, and we clicked immediately. We slept together on the second day of knowing each other, and the chemistry is undeniable. We laugh, have fun, and just feel so natural together.
	•	But outside of those moments, I often feel anxious and insecure because he’s not big on consistent communication. He’s told me he’s not romantic or intentional, and he’s focused on his career goals.
	•	He cares about me, but he’s been honest that love isn’t his priority right now. I can’t help but feel anxious when we’re apart.
	•	He’s also made it clear that sex is important to him, and stopping it would mean the end of the relationship.

The Lies I Told the Guy I Like:
	•	When we met, I lied about my career. I told him I was a nurse, but I’m actually studying a caregiving program.
	•	I lied about my age and made myself seem younger than I am.
	•	I even lied about my ex, saying he was dead instead of admitting the truth about my breakup.
	•	Our relationship feels built on lies, and I’m scared the truth will ruin things.

My Dilemma:
I know Guy 1 can give me a stable, secure future, but I don’t feel anything for him. I dread seeing him, and I miss Guy 2 when I’m with him. But with Guy 2, I feel so deeply connected and happy, but I’m afraid he’ll never give me the consistency or commitment I want.

My friends are saying I should date both and see what happens, but it feels wrong. I don’t know if I should just walk away from Guy 2 and try to love Guy 1 or be honest with Guy 2 and hope for the best.

I’m scared of being alone and making the wrong choice. I feel stuck.

What would you do in my situation? Should I tell Guy 2 the truth? Is it worth holding on to something so unstable? Would it be foolish to choose passion over stability?

(Sorry if i make grammar mistakes English isn’t my first language) I’m 17 y.o soon to be an adult eldest daughter of my family. I have a pretty good relationships and social life but never had the best when it comes to my parents. They believe that abusing their children physically and mentally is the right way to raise them because they were raised that way. So even when i was a toddler they would beat me if i do something wrong or behaved badly. But not for so long because they left me off to some relatives to take care of me so they can do their job. So for 6 years i barely ever interacted with them. I really missed them in the first few years i was only 6 year old and the family that took care of me… i guess you could say they weren’t the greatest the father was an alcoholic who comes home drunk everyday and have yelling match with his wife the daughter was older than me and always bullied me took my money and make me do chores and took credit for it lol. Lil me would just go into their bathroom and cry until i calm down and try to look like i haven’t been crying. Looking back it really left a big scar in my heart cause every-time i remember those days tears will just start running down uncontrollably. But my parents never really understood that pain and will just say i am an entitled brat for not understanding their situation and struggle. To this day everyone complimented how mature and introverted i am for my age but i never wanted to be this way. I struggle with social anxiety everyday because i had no one to talk about myself so i just kept everything to myself till this day. When i started living with my parents again things weren’t so bad until i became a teenager and my parents started demanding that i became the third parent of my siblings. I tried to be a good older sister i really tried you know i started cooking when i was 9 y.o and and was constantly cooking and cleaning for them by the time i was 12 but it was never enough especially for my mom . She would just lunge at me if she came to a messy home. At first i took the beatings but it became unbearable. she would kick me out in -30c cold winter with no clothes just because I didn’t cook that day and so on. I finally had enough at 14 and started yelling back at her but it just only made it worse and 14-16 was just hell of a years haha. At first dad took my side but yeah he had enough and just started ignoring me when my mother was beating me i was so helpless at that time even tried to k*ll myself multiple times because I couldn’t take it but i was just too stubborn to die so i just started ignoring my mom i would just silently took the beatings until she calms down. And if you are wondering child protecting services around my town sucks by the way they wouldn’t even take their call when i tried to call them. And even if they cared and took my mother away everybody would just hate me so i just gave up. 
And for nearly two years it was going kinda okay but now i’m nearly an adult and going to a college in few months. They started freaking out on how such a disappointment like me is going to live and be burden to their name and image. So they just despised me a society’s parasite (that’s how they refer to me)
Would just end up in the streets… (i’m actually pretty bright student btw straight A’s etc so I don’t know why they think so low of me) And they would just constantly freak out and beat me today was my mother’s breaking point ig. When she came home I haven’t really done the dishes yet and she just exploded and came wailing at me she stomped on me and everytime i tried to get up she would kick my head and when i tried to defend myself it just made it worse she sat on top of me and started punching and slapping me left and right because she was so heavy and strong in the end I couldn’t even scream and resist and then ran out of breath and lost consciousness when I finally gained consciousness i couldn’t move my body or open my eyes i was just crying mess on the floor and my father… he just looked at me and said i am the worst thing ever happened to them. I really really wanted to end my life right then and there but i just couldn’t. I’m only 17 years old i want to go to a good university and become a badass engineer and explore the world. I haven’t even experienced my first love yet. I wanted to wear a pretty dress and attend prom too. So i just couldn’t bring myself to do it… So please give me some advice on how to continue living this life i am graduating in two months and taking my entrance exam soon . And my parents probably would abandon me after that. I suck at jobs that require physical ability. And waiter’s job here costs like 50 cents an hour and probably won’t hire me. So what can i do to live and what can i do to perform well in my entrance exam. Any advice would be very helpful. And thank you so much for reading all this. (And any hack for getting rid of swollen face and those red freckles like things that appear after i cried so much. They are so annoying and would stay there for weeks. And my body just hurts all over so what can i do.

1jqq2t9,offmychest,1743704744.0,"I (26f) read my boyfriend's (26m) diary and found out that he lied to me multiple times. Sorry for my English, it is not my first language, but I'm hoping someone will understand what I wrote and give me an advice.

The post will be long so thank you to everyone who will read all of it.

Me (26F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for almost a year now. For the purpose of this post, I’ll refer to him as Mark. We initially met five years ago while working at the same company during the summer holidays.

We went on a couple of dates, but nothing came of it, and we lost touch.

Two years later, I saw him on Tinder and swiped right just for fun since he was an old acquaintance. We had both been in different relationships in the meantime, which had ended a few months before. Our reunion turned into a casual affair that lasted about 2.5 months. I realized I had feelings for him but pretended to be fine with just being sex buddies because it seemed like he didn’t want a relationship at the time.

Our romance kind of faded naturally, and we didn’t talk for a few months until he reached out and asked me to go for a beer. Nothing sexual happened or was even mentioned. It was just a friendly chat, and we went out a couple more times.

A month and a half later, I found out he had a girlfriend, and they had been together for at least three months at that point. As you can imagine, I was surprised, as he never mentioned being with anyone. I also felt hurt because I thought that our romance had ended due to his busy schedule, and since he had a girlfriend, I felt like something was wrong with me for him not wanting to pursue a relationship.

I decided to ask him. I wanted to know if maybe I was doing something wrong, whether there was something about my personality I needed to work on, etc. I honestly just wanted some feedback and a male perspective.

He gave me a very respectful, long answer. He said that we just misunderstood each other—he wanted a relationship with me, but I gave him the impression that I was fine with just sex. He complimented me a lot, especially my personality, and it hurt to find out he was with someone else, but it was also a lesson for me to communicate my feelings more openly.

I told him that I needed to process everything. I wanted to be friends with him, but I needed to get over my bitterness. I didn’t want to pretend to be his friend while secretly hoping for him and his girlfriend to break up. I wished them both well, even though it hurt me. I didn’t want to be a toxic person, so I told him that until I got over my feelings, I couldn’t stay in touch. I removed all of our conversations and moved on.

He texted me five months later, asking if I wanted to go out. He acknowledged that I wanted to stay away but said he wanted me to know that if I agreed, we could grab a drink as friends.

I agreed. At this point, I was over him. I had worked really hard on myself over the past few months and finally built my self-esteem to the point where I didn’t feel the need for male validation. I was fine being alone and wanted to focus on pursuing my goals. I had also gained more experience in different types of romantic relationships and realized that low-commitment relationships weren’t for me. I tend to get attached too quickly, so I promised myself that my next relationship, whenever it happens, must be serious and exclusive.

Our one-time ""beer"" date turned into regular meetings and chatting. We talked about everything, including our past relationships and what went wrong. He became a really good friend, and for the first time, I felt like I was actually being myself with a man. I didn’t have the overwhelming need to impress him. I stood my ground, called him out on his bullshit, and I could see that he respected that. We both changed a lot as people from when we first met.

This lasted for five months, and then we became a couple. It felt very natural. Like we had actually gotten to know each other and knew what we wanted. I could see that over the past few months, he had really been trying to make up for his previous behavior and had been pursuing me a lot.

So here we are, almost one year as a couple. I can honestly say that I’m very happy in our relationship. He treats me very well, supports my dreams, and pushes me to do more with my life. He is caring and loving. Last year wasn’t easy for me: I found out I had health issues, my father passed away suddenly, I had to change apartments, I lost my job, and didn’t get paid for the last month I worked. It was very intense, and he supported me through all of this. We are also planning on moving in together soon, and we’ve talked about things like marriage and having kids in the future. I love him so much, and I could see us growing old together.

A couple of days ago, he went on a business trip and let me stay in his apartment because I’m having some issues with my roommate and wanted some peace. I was studying and needed some paper to jot a few things down, so I opened one of the notebooks on the shelf next to the desk. It turned out it was Mark’s diary. He started writing in it around the time we first met. I know it was wrong, but I read it.

I found out that around the time we had our first couple of dates, he was really into a girl he met online. They hadn’t actually met in real life, but he was obsessed with her. He wrote so beautifully about her, and he was very sad when she ignored him or didn’t text back. I would’ve found it cute if not for the fact that he was seeing me at the time. We weren’t exclusive, and we didn’t do anything more than kiss, but I still would’ve liked to know that he had feelings for someone else.

The worst part is that, at the same time, he was sleeping with another girl who worked at the same company we did. All this time, he never mentioned that they had an affair, even though I brought her up several times, remembering old times when we worked together. I feel like an idiot now.

Even though he met me at the time, I was barely mentioned in his diary. He only once mentioned me in comparison to the girl he was obsessed with. He noted that his friend said I was much, much prettier, but in his (Mark’s) opinion, I was ""no MISS.""

He only noted that we weren’t going to see each other again, and that’s all.

Then, two years later, during our short affair, he wrote that this was the last time he saw me because I wasn’t the person for him. Why, then, lie months later and tell me he wanted a relationship with me?

During our relationship, he only mentioned me in relation to what he did that day—""I went to a restaurant with XYZ""—but there were no ""lovey-dovey"" descriptions of love, like he had for that one girl.

Another thing: Mark has a friend who is a girl. She is now in a long-term relationship with her girlfriend. They met on Tinder and went on a date during the time we didn’t see each other for two years. I was fine with this, thinking they just realized they weren’t a match and became friends. I actually encouraged him to spend more time with her, thinking it would benefit him to go out with friends instead of just staying home and working. He told me they only kissed, and later renewed contact and became good friends since she helped him heal from a breakup. But from his diary, I found out they actually had sex—without penetration, but still. It changed their relationship in my mind, and I feel like an idiot for not knowing that. When we started our relationship last year, he brought me to meet her. Would I have gone knowing that his ""friend"" was also his past lover? Probably not, because it’s kind of awkward.

One last thing: The girl he was with before he reached out to me again after I went no contact. He said they broke up at the end of November or the beginning of December, but from the diary, I found out they actually broke up in January. He texted me in January, no more than two weeks after their breakup. I just feel stupid. Like he literally tried to be with anyone else before settling with me.

I didn’t feel like he settled, not even once during our relationship. He tells me he loves me often and does romantic things. He tells me I’m beautiful very often, but now I can’t help but wonder if he lies about everything. If he didn’t find me attractive back then, why even ask me to go out? And I’m having a hard time believing his compliments are honest right now, because I didn’t change that much. I just stopped dyeing my hair and went to my natural color, and I have more money for nice clothes. 

Apart from that, not much has changed about my appearance. Honestly, I didn’t expect him to be so harsh on me. I think I’m quite pretty. I haven’t questioned that in years, because a lot of people, from both sexes, have told me the same. I’m not saying everyone should think that, but of all people, I would’ve thought my boyfriend should. I know he wrote this five years ago, but still.

And what else has he lied about?

I’m just not sure how I can trust him with anything right now. I can honestly say that I haven’t lied about anything to him. Honesty is very important to me. Maybe he hasn’t told me these things because he knew it would put him in a bad light.

So Reddit, what should I do? Should I approach him? Should I tell him that I read his diary?


TL,DR:  *From the diary I found that when I first met my boyfriend he was having an affair with our coworker and a crush on a girl he met online. He never told me this even though I brought her as a person multiple times in our conversations.
* He lied about not having sex with one of his friends during the time we lost contant before becoming a couple
* He lied to me about a timeline of his breakup with his previous girlfriend. From the diary I found out that he was single only for twoo weeks before reaching out to me again.
* If lying comes so easy to him I am starting to wondering what else he lied about?

1jqp5y7,offmychest,1743702694.0,"Friend can't rely on her husband, overly relies on me. I'm exhausted and annoyed. Friend (f30s) I'm going to call Stephanie. She and her husband (m30s) Brock have three young boys. The oldest is autistic and requires a lot of extra support from Stephanie. She's honestly a super mom. She's a leader in our secular homeschool co-op and always coming up with the best kid friendly outings for our mom friend group. 

Stephanie however, never gets a break. Every. We've been friends for two years and have hung out without our children *twice*. Both times involved her husband calling and texting nonstop asking when she'd be home. Brock is incapable of handling their children, even the smallest tasks or the shortest periods of time. He gets stressed out incredibly easily for a man who takes frequent solo vacations without the family. Oh yeah! That's right. He's Brock because this man child spends all of his spare money and time traveling around to Pokemon tournaments. Now I'm a nerd, my husband and I cosplay with our kids and go to cons together so I'm not calling him a man child for caring about Pokemon. He's a man child imo because he acts like Steph's fourth child

A few months back, I watched the older two for them for an overnight while Steph was in the ER with her youngest after he broke a bone at the playground. This guy apparently made her drive him to the airport before taking their son to the ER because he couldn't miss his tournament. Hearing that really annoyed me but I let it go because it was an emergency and I'm always happy to help my friends. The problem is that Steph has been calling and asking for help A LOT since then. 

Now I don't mind scheduling playdates or anything but every week there's something. Can I watch kiddo 2 so Steph can take kiddo 3 to this or that event? No, Brock can't watch him, he gets too overwhelmed. He's jetlagged. He's tired. He's overworked (9-5, M-F office job for reference). All of the reasons make sense I guess but I find myself becoming a bit resentful. I finally said no recently because I had something already scheduled for the day and hated myself for it. She was so upset and said she didn't have anyone to rely on. 

I'm just tired. Tired of hearing her complain about a man who she'll never leave because her oldest needs the support she can give by being a stay at home mom. I'm tired of watching my friend burn the candle at both ends while this guys bops around like he doesn't have three young kids at home.

I made a turn and suddenly I couldn't see out my windshield and rather than stopping All I could do was panic... I didn't.. I mean I knew the right thing would have been to step on my brakes or at the very least roll down my window so that way I could stick my head out and see where I was going but I didn't. Instead All I could do was mess with the AC controls as if that would do something while repeating ""Not safe"" inside my head over and over again. By the time I came slightly more to my senses and stuck my head out the window I was in the complete wrong lane and it was by the grace of God that I didn't hit or kill anybody in a head on collision. My car ran completely over the curb and I managed to make it to my destination in one piece because it was right there, but then I spent the next 45 minutes in my car crying and shaking and screaming and struggling to breathe with my mom and partner on the phone talking me through it.

i hate the way you treated me throughout our relationship. i hate the way i lost my virginity to you. every single time we hung out up until we did it for the first time you asked me if i wanted to have sex behind a fucking dumpster in my car in the parking lot of our fast food job we met at. i told you over and over that i didn't want my first time to be in a car and you kept asking me anyway until i eventually said yes. the whole time i was terrified and upset because i knew that's not how i wanted my first time to go but all you cared about was a 5 minute good time. you didn't even cuddle with me after.. you barely even looked at me after. i still stayed with you for almost 3 years. i didn't say no because i didn't want you to overthink and feel like i didn't want to because i wasn't attracted to you. maybe it's my fault for not saying no. 

i felt the same uncomfortable and scared feeling years later when you pushed my head down when i was giving you head and i told you i didn't like it. you said ""you're gonna do it whether you like it or not"". those words are burned in my head now. i don't know if you were just in the heat of the moment and didn't really mean that. you asked me why im still with you when i told you it was hard for me to see you after this and made me feel like im the crazy one when i just needed space. maybe it's my fault for needing too much space. maybe i made you feel like a monster for just pushing my head down. maybe i'm overreacting.

what's funny is if you texted me right now and asked if we could try again i would say yes. maybe i'm too forgiving.. or too loving.. because i still love you even though you did that and much more. was i just a piece of meat to you or did you mean it every time you told me you loved me? i don't know.. it's been almost 2 months since we've last talked and i miss you so much and love you just as much as i did when we were together but i hate you for how you took advantage of my love. fuck you",hate much throwaway case find hate way treated throughout relationship hate way lost virginity every single time hung first time asked wanted sex behind fucking dumpster car parking lot fast food job met told didnt want first time car kept asking anyway eventually said yes whole time terrified upset knew thats wanted first time go cared minute good time didnt even cuddle barely even looked still stayed almost years didnt say didnt want overthink feel like didnt want wasnt attracted maybe fault saying felt uncomfortable scared feeling years later pushed head giving head told didnt like said youre gonna whether like words burned head dont know heat moment didnt really mean asked im still told hard see made feel like im crazy one needed space maybe fault needing much space maybe made feel like monster pushing head maybe im overreacting whats funny texted right asked could try would say yes maybe im forgiving loving still love even though much piece meat mean every time told loved dont know almost months since weve last talked miss much love much together hate took advantage love fuck,1,0,Neutral,Low Concern

1jqjhql,offmychest,1743689509.0,"Lost 3000€ to a rental scam Mandatory : this happened in january but I am just now sharing with anyone other than my bank and the police.

So I (21M) moved to France at the start of this year, and things started off badly, with me falling for a rental scam.

Essentially I responded to an ad on a rental website (seloger) for a studio rental for 1000€. 

I got an email the day after, where the scammer showed me photos of the studio. We started talking via whatsapp, and the person asked me for my ID, which initially seemed normal. She would then send a copy of her own ID (now it's obvious she stole someone else's), and scheduled a visit for when I arrived in France. 

Here is where it went south, she started by asking to pay the 1st months rent (1K) upfront as a standard part of the process and she sent me a (make believe) rental contract for me to sign and send. The contract seemed legitimate so I went along. After a while, I asked her to send proof of ownership, to which she sent a property tax statement. After a while, she asked for a caution of two months rent which, again, was in the contract. I told her I would rather pay when we met but she claimed it was needed before as international rental laws were different. I stupidly went along with it.

Needless to say, on the day of the visit, no one showed up, I stood 3 hours outside the building. I then recieved an email from the rental website saying the ad I responded to was suspected of fraud.

I immediately filed a police report and reported everything to Revolut. Revolut wasn’t able to retrieve the money I wired and I still have no answer from the police (I'm not hopeful for one tbh). Also made a new passport at the embassy so that the one I showed was voided

I stayed in a hostel for a couple nights and then I managed to rent a room in a shared flat where I still am

1jqivnj,offmychest,1743687995.0,"I used AI but now I'm getting accused when I did not I am panicking so bad because I kind of used AI on two discussion posts but I stopped when I saw a zero. But now another discussion has been flagged what do I do???? I wrote an email but have not sent it yet. Here is the email.
I am emailing you regarding AI use. I must admit that for discussion board three and four I used ai as a reference thinking it was okay if I did not copy exactly. I am very sorry I did this and once I saw my grade on discussion board three, I stopped using ai entirely. However, I just looked at my submitted Dropbox for discussion board six and saw the Turnitin score is higher than the other two? 
I have been doing a little research and found that Turnitin can sometimes target certain writing styles and is not always accurate. Additionally, Turnitin saves previous information and looks for similar phrases or words. This means that not only may I have a writing style that seems like AI, but it could be noticing phrases and words I use a lot from previous things that have been turned in. I have also read that AI generators like Chat GPT are becoming more humanlike meaning it is starting to sound more like how many people write. A lot of people have had issues with Turnitin and as AI gets more advanced it is having to count more things as AI. One last thing is when Grammarly changes sentences on a student's paper to fix the grammatical structure, it can make things sound like AI. I have tried to get rid of the Grammarly pop up on my computer, but it always comes back, and I press correct without thinking about it.
I would also like to say that if you look at discussion boards three and four compared to six, they are very different, or at least I think so. I can also show you my Chat GPT history of the last few months, there is not much there. I have also been plugging it in to other free AI detectors that seem reliable and while the first two are said to have moderate AI, discussion board six is said to be completely human. Most of my research has been from google but I have been trying to find academic sources too. Lastly, I want to apologize for such a long email, I am just very worried about this. I am also worried more of my stuff will get flagged, so I am going to screen record myself writing the next discussion board if I can figure out how to. I am especially worried my paper will be flagged, but I have also run that through the AI detectors I have access to, and it is not flagged by them. The most I have to offer you as far as proof goes is screenshots of the other detectors I have used, screenshots of Chat GPT history, and whatever research I can find.

1jqit8u,offmychest,1743687826.0,"Feeling generally hopeless, now landlord won’t let me have a pet The last few months have been tough - I’ve (31F) absolutely found myself becoming depressed. I’ve lost all motivation for the things I enjoy, and used to read about 10 books a month, run three times a week, and see friends at least once a month. It’s now been 6 months since I read a book, my running is worse than ever, and I can’t remember when I last saw my friends. I feel like everything I try at I fail, and I feel like, while I don’t actively want to die, I’m not sure what I’m living for. Work is relentless, I’ve never had a relationship in my life (or come particularly close) - I’m just feeling a bit hopeless about it all.

In attempts to give myself some purpose, I asked my landlord if I could have a cat. I know getting pets won’t fix my mental health, but I know for sure that it would help, and as much as I’ve been feeling down I know that I would look after it well and it would bring me a great amount of joy. Unfortunately the landlord has just said that they don’t feel ‘comfortable’ having pets at the property, and all of a sudden the only thing I could think of to feel better about my life is gone. I offered to make good any potential damages (it’s not a particularly nice flat, being honest), and told them the extensive experience I had looking after cats growing up. Didn’t seem to make a difference.

I’m sad, and angry, and bitter that I’m likely doomed to live the rest of my life renting in places that refuse pets (the current state of the cost of living means that saving for a deposit is nigh on impossible). At the rate things are going I’m unlikely to find a long-term partner either, so I just can’t envision a point in life where this will turn around for me.

I just needed to get this all out. I honestly don’t mind if no one reads this or if it gets deleted straightaway. Just wanted to vent. Hope you’re all doing okay.

1jqi7ms,offmychest,1743686281.0,"Inappropriate comment made by husband y husband(m/49) and I(f/41) have been together almost 12 yrs. Married 7. 
The past two years have been extremely rough. We fight, no sex life, and he annoys the hell out of me.

We are friends. He's not physically abusive, but he's just weird. I've begged him to go to therapy for almost 10yrs now. He struggles a lot with childhood trauma and abandonment issues. 

Last night, was the final straw. 
He had an extremely stressful day at work. He came home depressed and started drinking. We were talking at the kitchen table and he asked if we had any plans for the weekend. 
I reminded him I had a child (m/12) coming over on Sat to sleep over (it's my friends son. He passed away in 2021 and son is having a rough time.) His son also recently came out to me as gay. 

Immediately after telling him this my husband suggested I ask my nephew (m/21) who is also gay, to come over so they could ""hook up."" 

I flipped out and reminded him that my nephew is an adult man and child is only 12. He continued to say that he didn't know their ages, but still tried to justify that the age gap was normal. When I continued to yell and tell him to stop. He proceeded. He then made gestures with his hands(insinuating sex between the boys.) 

I told him I was going to call the police. That's when he stopped and went to bed. 

I slept on the couch and he came down at 2am asking what was wrong. I reminded him what he said. He continued to try and justify his words. He did apologize but I don't even want to look at him. I'm disgusted and I also don't want my friends son to come over now. WHAT DO I DO??

1jqgcl0,offmychest,1743681034.0,"My family is so toxic that I can’t move out at the risk of my pets lives I (18F) have a very bad relationship with my family. Rooting for my parents divorce since 8 years old, hating them both for not splitting (they have threatened divorce countless times, sleep in seperate rooms, barely talk or sit together unless to fight - very hostile home environment) and my siblings (20F and 17M) agree they suck

My father is ungodly absent, he started a business that he can’t manage and has left him always working to fix it, pouring his money troubles on me (who now has crippling financial anxiety) and always said that if he didn’t fix xyz by abc we would end up on the street. You want to hang with him? Forget your hobbies and interests, we are watching crap movies since he refuses to rewatch things he’s already seen. He drinks wine 24/7 and has made the entire family lounge room his own personal office.

My mum on the other hand is just something else. Couldn’t even explain it other than insane, maybe narcissistic. She’s the type of parent to scream and yell at you till you cry, then roll her eyes and why you’re even cry. She stopped letting me drive on my Ls for 9 months cause I asked her to drop screaming at me in the car since it gave me panic attacks. She also always tells me how everything I do is never fully correct, is a constant hover of failure over my shoulder and has emancipated me (in heart and to my face) and kicked me out of the house numerous times the last few years, once because I was walking around the house like “I owned the place” when all I was doing was getting ready for work. (Her father had recently died, and that whole time she let out most of her grief and anger out on me. Even if she didn’t, it sure as hell felt like it)

These parents sighed and huffed and puffed when they had to take me to the ER for trying to kill myself, and instead of trying to help me, went through my phone, found out I had s*x as an almost 18 year old and said the only therapy I’d get would be to get rid of my hideous behaviour (no we are not religious at all)

Now I’m at my last straws. I’m 18 yet I can’t move out. I have 2 amazing cats who are the light of my life. One cat, A, had a peeing problem. We used to have an older cat who she was scared of and in result peed in washing and other places. When I was a kid and didn’t know how to car for cats properly (despite my parents forcing the whole responsibility on me) I didn’t know how to stop it. Now as an adult the problem is barely there. Only when she is terrified or if my parent neglectfully leaves baskets of washing in the hallway for days.
I’ve advices lids for the baskets, more cat litter boxes so they have more options, stopping our dogs from chasing and terrorising them, but they don’t care. Now that I want to move out, my parents are keeping some sort of sick control on me by saying that if I leave, there is a 99% chance they will kill the cats because A pees in things and out other cat B is so shy that she won’t leave my room other than to cuddle with me.

That’s fucking terrifying. They are the type of parents that say “if you move out, you have to give us everything we ever paid for you because those are our things” but to stop me running away would claim I couldn’t buy phones or laptops if my own until I was 18 (which I am now) at risk that they would take them and destroy them (this happened once)

I want to move out so bad, get out of this environment (which my sister very much tells me and my brother need. In her words “the real world is a breathe of fresh air and honestly I had no clue how to navigate it because our parents are such bad examples of what love and parenting should be”) but I have a jaw surgery they are holding over my head, that if I leave the house they won’t pay for it (despite this being in progress since I was 12.) And the first time I wanted to move out, they claimed I had to return the car (despite the deal everyone else in the family gets is if you go to uni they will provide a car until age 25 - I am in uni on my own dime), phone, laptop, and everything else they gave me. And when I asked to move out, I suggested still having Sunday dinners and doing jobs at the house when I came over, which was apparently “stealing only the benefits of having a family and not taking any of the work” aka, “you want to ditch us with all this stuff we gifted you as you grew up and see us and love us? But not do chores and work and help around the house? No!”

I am actually stuck. I’m so scared for my cats lives. I am honestly so mentally unwell. I’m banned from seeing a therapist (since when I saw one at 11 for suicidal thoughts, the therapist called me dramatic and attention seeking, a term my mum had thrown at me for the rest of my life) which I just hate. Until I’m out from under this roof I can’t get help. I will be out of a car, a phone, everything I need for my uni, all because I want to be the adult that I am, all because I thought the gift that my older sister got (who also shares my hatred and barely talks to our parents) the same as me would be mine to keep too. 

I hate thinking about my next day. Like having no support. Or fake support, or support that comes in the form of “you owe me now” for a life I never asked for. It’s such a burden on my chest and I can’t imagine living. My GF (18F) is a wonderful human being who strongly believes I need to get out, but there is no situation where I can take the cats with me, and I doubt I could resell them to good people because of their behaviours. It’s heart breaking. I am trapped in this house until the day they day, and still that means my freedom only comes by the hands of their death and I hate that that’s something I’m supposed to want.",family toxic cant move risk pets lives f bad relationship family rooting parents divorce since years old hating splitting threatened divorce countless times sleep seperate rooms barely talk sit together unless fight hostile home environment siblings f agree suck father ungodly absent started business cant manage left always working fix pouring money troubles crippling financial anxiety always said didnt fix xyz abc would end street want hang forget hobbies interests watching crap movies since refuses rewatch things hes already seen drinks wine made entire family lounge room personal office mum hand something else couldnt even explain insane maybe narcissistic shes type parent scream yell till cry roll eyes youre even cry stopped letting drive ls months cause asked drop screaming car since gave panic attacks also always tells everything never fully correct constant hover failure shoulder emancipated heart face kicked house numerous times last years walking around house like owned place getting ready work father recently died whole time let grief anger even didnt sure hell felt like parents sighed huffed puffed take er trying kill instead trying help went phone found sx almost year old said therapy id get would get rid hideous behaviour religious im last straws im yet cant move amazing cats light life one cat peeing problem used older cat scared result peed washing places kid didnt know car cats properly despite parents forcing whole responsibility didnt know stop adult problem barely terrified parent neglectfully leaves baskets washing hallway days ive advices lids baskets cat litter boxes options stopping dogs chasing terrorising dont care want move parents keeping sort sick control saying leave chance kill cats pees things cat b shy wont leave room cuddle thats fucking terrifying type parents say move give us everything ever paid things stop running away would claim couldnt buy phones laptops risk would take destroy happened want move bad get environment sister much tells brother need words real world breathe fresh air honestly clue navigate parents bad examples love parenting jaw surgery holding head leave house wont pay despite progress since first time wanted move claimed return car despite deal everyone else family gets go uni provide car age uni dime phone laptop everything else gave asked move suggested still sunday dinners jobs house came apparently stealing benefits family taking work aka want ditch us stuff gifted grew see us love us chores work help around house actually stuck im scared cats lives honestly mentally unwell im banned seeing therapist since saw one suicidal thoughts therapist called dramatic attention seeking term mum thrown rest life hate im roof cant get help car phone everything need uni want adult thought gift older sister got also shares hatred barely talks parents would mine keep hate thinking next day like support fake support support comes form owe life never asked burden chest cant imagine living gf f wonderful human strongly believes need get situation take cats doubt could resell good people behaviours heart breaking trapped house day day still means freedom comes hands death hate thats something im supposed want,0,1,Negative,Low Concern
1jqhv5b,offmychest,1743685366.0,"UPDATE: I'm very proud of my husband today Thanks to everyone who commented on my last post which you can go see on my profile since I can't link to it here. Firstly I'd like to say thank you to everyone who was supportive, it meant a lot and I spent a lot of time getting misty-eyed every time I saw a new comment. I read some to him last night, he was so touched. Seriously, you guys are amazing!!

So for those looking for an update, here it is: my husband had that meeting with the boss this morning. He didn't have time to get a lawyer, but he recorded it. Basically the boss wanted him to take over the manager's position as production manager for the entire design and fabrication department (for context if anyone is interested, they're a large format printing company and print banners, building wraps, billboards, car wraps etc and other smaller things like promotional materials like mugs, pens, stickers, drink trays, promotional gifts etc etc etc.) So the boss wanted him to take over production and still do the designs. It would mean more work, more stress, more authority...... and not more money.

He said that apparently I am earning more than the boss is, and he can't afford to up his salary more than 2%. Which I think is BS. Like fuck OFF, that's such a lie. He has three kids in a really expensive private school, a big house in a nice neighbourhood, and multiple vehicles. Add to that the mortgage for the office & factory space, the machinery & large format printers which is a cool few million altogether (in my currency because I'm not based in America). He also gives his kids literally whatever they want and they take regular holidays.

I know he does a fair bit of business on a ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" basis, so his school fees might be partially subsidised by doing free branding for the school a few times a year. But even then I still don't believe he can't afford to pay one of his oldest employees what he's worth according to experience + qualifications. Just a competitive, market-related salary? Nah.

You also can't just get extended lines of credit in perpetuity, so even if he's got loans for his house, cars, machinery, office & factory space... I still don't believe that he's simply can't afford it. He could have investments or savings, I guess. But my husband has seen the quotes for some of the jobs they do, and I'm talking hundreds of thousands worth - up to a million for a building wrap/billboard. Even if most of it is being swallowed up by debt, it doesn't account for the kid's gaming rigs, steering wheels for racing games, vintage pinball machines, a custom foosball table once, new ipads/iphones whenever there's a new one out. He also collects old Alfa Romeo cars he's hoping to fix up and I've seen them. There are about 4 chassis/vehicles parked next to the factory. It just doesn't add up to me. Just thinking back to how we struggled to make ends meet before I got this job without having kids to pay for, I just don't believe it. And I mean it when I say it, their lifestyle is LUSH.

I think the boss was hoping that the manager gone + better position, more authority & control would be enough to keep my husband there, but to be honest his salary was just above minimum wage. He could probably get a better salary somewhere else in a mid-level position without being treated so poorly.

He's still considering reporting it to the CCMA (the public entity that resolves workplace disputes in my country) but for now he's quit and is at home and looking for work. He could stay home if he wanted but I just personally believe that he needs a purpose other than cleaning the house and cooking, and he wants to earn his own money so he can spoil himself and me.

On the charge of threatened assault front - no news there. Justice moves sloooooow here and the cops have bigger fish to fry than threatened assault charges so honestly if anything concrete actually happens before the manager catches a flight to the UK in a few weeks, I'll be surprised.

What's most important is that he's out of that environment and alive. He's already feeling so much better, I can see it in the way he holds himself, walks around, talks. So there you have it!

And to the people who think this is fake, that's cool LMAO. The fact is that a person can get used to a lot of poor treatment at work and for a long time if they're desperate for the money. Jobs here aren't plentiful and the cost of living is pretty high and only getting higher. I only just got a new job that has provided him the breathing room he needed and the confidence to leave. Also we're talking about a severely depressed person here. Yeah, it took three years and a single, first high paycheck from his partner's new job to convince him that it's possible to earn more and be treated better. It's also laughable to assume that everyone (let alone a DTP artist designing entire fucking billboards) works off a laptop instead of a desktop, I don't know. Maybe get real LOL. That's all there is to it, you can believe that this happened or not, I'm gonna move on and enjoy having a happy, alive husband.

edit: I also posted to a local subreddit a few weeks ago asking about the legalities about ""my friend's"" treatment at work.

1jqeoxj,offmychest,1743675397.0,"My partner is lost and seems very disconnected.. how do I help? Please be kind, I don’t normally make these kinds of posts. Just need some insight in case others have also gone through this. My boyfriend has always had times where he gets into “moods”, as he calls it. He says it hard to explain but it’s always lingering and sometimes it comes stronger than other days. I believe it to be depression, though a diagnosis has not been made. In my opinion, it has never been this bad before. 

He has slowly over the course of the last year or so started to seem more distant, way more wrapped up in work, and altogether less present. I knew things were happening to the relationship that concerned me. I would bring it up but try to give him grace when it’s not fixed right away or when he seemed distant because he has a very demanding job and our schedules can be polar opposites for months at a time. 

I’m coming to accept that this is just where we’re at now. I tried to put into my mind when I noticed little things here and there that it was because of his job or because he’s tired this week. But it has remained constant.

Here’s what I’ve noticed: He doesn’t try like he used to when it comes to fixing or putting work into the relationship. He has made some decisions that were quite odd to me since we’ve been together for 5 years. We used to be attached at the hip and now it’s like he makes little effort: not reaching out at all when I was on my trip or him volunteering to work his days off when we hadn’t seen much of each other. He used to say, “okay, you’re feeling this way, what can I do? How can I help you”. He doesn’t anymore. He shuts down when we have an uncomfortable or stressful topic of conversation come up and basically stonewalls me (which has been a thing in our relationship at times but way more frequently now..I try to be patient. I ask if we need to pause to give him time to process things and decompress). This happens even if he initiated the conversation. But then I need to be the one to bring it up again if we had paused or if we stopped speaking because he stops responding to me because “I don’t know what to say”. If I was the one upset at something he did, I have to be the one to reach out to make things better between us. 

If I tell him exactly how I am feeling and what I would desire from him, he does not do it. Example being: I told him I’d love to have a date night before I leave for my trip. We hadn’t had much quality time lately and had been a bit out of touch with each other. I thought it’d be nice to get out of the house together. He agreed. But then later he tells me that he scheduled himself to pull overtime.. knowing that we made a plan. Or: “what I need from you is to give a little reassurance when I bring this up, maybe give me a hug or hold my hand and tell me you hear me.”Doesn’t do that, just: “okay. Sorry”. And disassociates the rest of the evening. Doesn’t say goodnight or I love you when going to bed.

When I asked him why he does those things he said he’s not sure. He shared that he’s been feeling very lost and like all he does is hurt me. He feels like he doesn’t know what he’s doing and just making decisions on autopilot. 

It’s been slowly progressing to this point for a long while and it hurts me to know that our relationship has changed so much to where this is how we are now. I am only human.. I struggle between feeling neglected and abandoned in the relationship and trying to be there to the best of my ability and remember that he’s going through something I will never be able to fully understand the way he does.

All in all, even if we don’t last romantically, even if we can’t go back to what we used to have I would still like to help him in any way that I can. He is truly a wonderful person and has also helped me over the years through some of my personal struggles. Please let me know what you all think and what I can do on my end to help him through the tough times.
